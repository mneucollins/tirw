 Notes:
 Currently, search.php and phpheader access the db on research-intermedia.art.uiowa.edu
 
 They should, instead access a db on the iowareview.uiowa.edu site.
 I was unable to establish this connection remotely, perhaps due to tyring to sudo chown change owners of the vol9n2 folder.
 
 links in the research-intermedia database to ~iareview addresses have been updated appropriately. Need to update links to research-intermedia files.
 
 Would like to include TIRW as a menu from the TIR web site, but need it to open in a new window. Having difficulty achieving this, and it may involve a core hack.
 
 Need to test all links in "browse archive" historical files

Missing Folders archive03, archive04, archive05

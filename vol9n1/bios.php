	<h2><?if ($_GET['bio'] == '4') echo '<span class="red">'?>Jason Nelson<?if ($_GET['bio'] == '4') echo '</span>'?></h2>
  <p>Jason Nelson's digital artwork/poetics are built from net architecture experimentation, the rethinking/rebreeding of the text and images and movement and sounds of poetics and fictional worlds. And although he dearly misses the late winter snows of the Oklahoma Plains, those wispy cold winds, he is current a Griffith University Digital Art and Writing lecturer, living on the Golden Coast of Australia. His art/poetics site, <a href="http://secrettechnology.com/">secrettechnology.com</a>, has had over 3 million hits in 2006 and his strange net creations have won odd awards and been featured in contemporary art galleries in Spain, Argentina, the US, Japan, Singapore, Canada, UK, Russia, Australia, Germany and dozens of other, both obscure and prestigious venues.</p>

  <h2>Donna, what was your process for making <i>Deviant</i>?</h2>
  <p>As <i>Deviant</i> was a key part of my PhD submission, the process was very much transparent and mapped (see Chapter 2 of my thesis <a href="http://www.6amhoover.com/viva" target="_new">http://www.6amhoover.com/viva</a>). Firstly, I came upon the narrative at a Scottish History conference where I was searching for interesting real-life sources to create a new project. The demonic possession of Christian Shaw was only mentioned in passing, but the demonizing of an 11-year-old Scottish girl, frequently painted as an evil manipulative character, was too much to pass up. I researched the differing scholarly opinions, but crucially discovered that the initial recorded written telling of the narrative was authored anonymously. These discoveries enabled me to ethically open-up, re-interpret, and re-position the various perspectives on Christian Shaw, and crucially to encourage the user to take their own stance.</p>
  <p>Once I had mapped out the skeleton of the core events, I began to embellish with additional narrative strains, many of which focused on giving Christian a presence&mdash;I hoped that this would create an emotional resonance. After the visual aesthetic was settled and the majority of the narrative constructed, I reworked the project, both whittling down the imagery and adding layers of detail. Once I had completed the whole of the narrative, I reviewed it as a user (rather than the author), seeing which tones it was "speaking with." I often find that to create vibrant interactive experiences space must be left for spontaneous or intuitive authorial creations. That done, I tested the work online and started "writing-up" what I felt were the project's interesting points, successes, and failures. Lastly, I invited a group of expert readers/users to experience the artwork. Their feedback enabled me to further frame this artwork as research.</p>

  <h2>Jason, what was your process for making <i>This Is How You Will Die</i>?</h2>
  <p>One: Found a slot machine fla file, the ready to go code of a game. Spent several weeks trying to redo, reconfigure, remake the code. Originally, I loaded it with sliced up scans of slides. My grandfather labeled a box of slides as "no good." After he died, while other family members barked over valuables, I slipped that box into my trunk. I am not a car, am not greased axles or roll up-roll down windows.</p>
  <p>Two: The slides, all blurred and secretly ill centered, did not fit, did not play nicely with the interface. So the file, or rather ten different files, for ten different stages of adjustment were lost amongst my cluttered folders.  </p>
  <p>Three: I cannot name files properly. Cannot keep organization, a coat pocket with receipts. Many weeks or months pass before I find this file again. An accidental mopping of the floor.</p>
  <p>Four: As a child, I did not fear death. This is not the clich&eacute; of kids feel invincible, but rather my early understanding of death as a bike spoke, if ten speeds could fly in outer space and spin out on narrow arboretum trails. Tall glass and temperature controlled. But more recently, I'm scared of dying, all middle-aged and late coming. My teeth hurt. My teeth hurt.</p>
  <p>Five: Secrets. The twin cousin, as this is not medically possible, of the secret society, the secret cure, the secret secret, the sequence of words parading for access to unmarked crates, is isolation, the alonity (alone combined with ity, and the e falls away) of long drives through fire flies. There is a story here, back rent, and a writing desk.</p>
  <p>Six: Deaths and secrets and slot machine codes.</p>

  <p>From <i>This Is How You Will Die</i></p>
  <p>Seven: But then why so funny, the stories of death? If you do find them humorous.</p>
  <p>To create this work I wrote 15 five-line stories. First: place of death (roughly). Second and Third: method of and circumstances surrounding death (less roughly). Fourth and Fifth: the happenings after death (funerals, responses, legacies). Initially I wanted them to work together grammatically. But then I remembered how scattershot, how ice storm my attention span has become. So, I simply kept to line by line, with five channels, each with 15 different possibilities.</p>
  <p>Seven again: But why so humorous?</p>

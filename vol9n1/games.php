  <h2>Donna, can you comment on how your work is or is not like a game?</h2>
  <p>Two opposing characteristics are that it works on a hiding / revealing premise (a game quality), yet suggests a narrative telling by the structuring of the islands of linear animation. The project can also be seen to use repetition as a metaphor, e.g. the circular looping within the pop-in windows depicting Christian's acts of possession (metaphors tend to be used in Art projects). The two main aspects share a similar drive towards achieving a goal: an end, narratively, or a conclusion, gaming-ly. Interestingly, a discussion already exists as to whether quantifiable outcomes, achieving the goals or endings, are a prerequisite of being understood as a game.</p>
  <p>Games designer Eric Zimmerman recently stated, "A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome." In contrast, Greg Costikyan believes in open-ended outcomes. Sitting in the middle is Jesper Juul with his "Classic Game Model." Juul, by using a demarcated timeline, suggests that contemporary rule-based systems can be something other than the classic model where a variable and quantifiable outcome is cited. Within <i>Deviant,</i> the endpoint serves to reposition the participant back towards confusion. As seen from a gaming viewpoint, the conclusion to the project does not offer participants an understanding of their role, of what the project's ultimate goals are. It does clarify its narrative source, explaining what has been visually experienced. It does something "other" than offer a narrative or gaming ending.</p>
  <p>This newness or refusal to be categorized led  some of the expert readers to attempt a general description of the project: exploratory narrative (George Fifield), visual narrative (Jill Walker), interactive experiment in moving visual art (Mark Amerika), and interface/game/interactive environment (Cynthia Lawson).</p>
<p>Personally I find the contemporary understanding of what a (video) game is doesn't fit the behavior of my work, and the definition of what a game is and does is ready to be expanded. However I think my work "plays games" with the user in terms of its playful trixy coquettishness.</p>

  <h2>Jason, can you comment on how your work is or is not like a game?</h2>
  <p>Many of my works are derived directly from game code. <i>This Is How You Will Die</i> uses the skeleton of an online slot machine to display its interactive narrative. <i>Ending: Chemistry,</i> a largely ignored work, never published, was created around a card game. And there are other works, like <i>The Bomar Gene,</i> that have game code within them, but where it is not a primary aspect. However the most common understanding of what a game is doesn't really apply to much digital work. Nor do I think it should.</p>
  <p>Most games have specific goals and consequences, competitions and scores. But with my work, I might have consequences in the vein of responses to user actions, but I find the notions of competition and score to be largely societal conceptions, false premises for cultural conquest.</p>
  <p>But if by game you mean play, Dear Gawd yes. I love play. If any artwork inspires play, whether on the screen or in the head's electric mass, then the creation pours awe from serving spoons, square plates, deeply filled with melted plastic and arbor day swimmers. Trees die in salt water floods, and ducks dive for the smaller, slower fish, warm feathers float longer in the cold.</p>

  <p>From <i>Superstitious Alliances</i></p>
  <p>Lately I've been playing with first person shooter game engines. I've been taking the open source code and fondling the folders for the images and sounds. And once I've identified the purpose of certain images, I create transparent jpegs of the same name or insert animated gifs of landscapes in the place of character movement files. Although my results so far haven't been very successful, the hope is the game will eventually look nothing like and play nothing like the original or any game.</p>
  <p>There is no way I can compete with large multi million dollar animation and coding budgets. So why not corrupt the game format entirely. To offer the hint that a user/reader/player is within a game environment, but birth their 3-dimensional experience to not resemble anything in the physical world.</p>

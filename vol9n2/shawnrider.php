			<h2> <a href="artworks/soRandom/index.php" target="_blank">So Random</a> </h2> 
			<p align="left">
				"So Random" is a short digital fiction. It is algorithmically composed on each reading of discreet lexia that are arranged according to temporal and content-based tags. The story combines four first-person narratives to provide a multi-faceted exploration of event and character focusing on point of view, reliability, and causation.

			<h2><a href="http://shawnrider.com/pitp/" target="_blank">PiTP</a></h2> 
			<p align="left">
				"PiTP" is the story of a college professor researching digital culture who finds himself on the wrong side of an intellectual property case. The story allows user-feedback, although that feedback can be considered destructive to the reading process. It is an experiment in participatory fiction and a satire of the wisdom of crowds.

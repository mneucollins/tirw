			</h2>
				    <p>Nick Montfort is assistant professor of digital media in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He earned a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in computer and information science. He earned masters degrees in media arts and sciences from MIT and in creative writing from Boston University.</p>

    <p>The digital media projects Montfort has undertaken include the blog <em>Grand Text Auto,</em> where he and five others write about computer narrative, poetry, games, and art; <em>Ream,</em> a 500-page poem written on one day; <em>Mystery House Taken Over,</em> a collaborative "occupation" of a classic game; <em>Implementation,</em> a novel on stickers written with Scott Rettberg; <em>The Ed Report,</em> a serialized novel written with William Gillespie; and several works of interactive fiction: <em>Book and Volume,</em> <em>Ad Verbum,</em> and <em>Winchester's Nightmare: A Novel Machine.</em></p>

    <p>Montfort edited <em>The Electronic Literature Collection Volume 1</em> (with N. Katherine Hayles, Stephanie Strickland, and Scott Rettberg, ELO, 2006) and <em>The New Media Reader</em> (with Noah Wardrip-Fruin, The MIT Press, 2003). He wrote <em>Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction</em> (The MIT Press, 2003), and, with William Gillespie, <em>2002: A Palindrome Story</em> (Spineless Books, 2002), which was acknowledged by the Oulipo as the world's longest literary palindrome. He is now investigating narrative variation in interactive fiction, the human meanings and machine functions of code, and the role of platforms in creative computing. Montfort and Ian Bogost have recently completed <em>Video Computer System: The Atari 2600 Platform</em> (coming from The MIT Press).</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="It_seemed.html">I am at a big reprehensible obstacle, you know.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">Your amusement park is closing for the day, maybe the season, and I stand here with a handful of tickets and no cotton candy.</a> 
<a href="Stop_reading.html">It's a good thing they didn't make me a fund manager.</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">This will at least provide some peace for the neighboring scribes, who will stop throwing their shoes into the noisiest rollercoaster.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">It is as if a tremendous and well-attended steel-driving competition is going on and I have been assigned the role of the steam drill.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">Why is it that as I gaze out into the sky above the urban night a tunnel is what is hammered home?</a> 
<a href="You_have.html">Perhaps the opaque dome of the heavens, lacking constellation, and the occasional commuter thrum are enough to accomplish that, the tunnel finished, the dig dug.</a> 
<a href="index.html">Any way you cut it you're in transit, rocks and hard places everywhere.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">I could grit my teeth, or growl, or hum, but there's always the option of getting back to work and singing.</a>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="Stop_reading.html">Cast the eyes somewhere else; cast the eyes there but don't focus them; cast the eyes there and focus them but stare at one point and one point only;</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">cast the eyes there and waggle them around in some way but not in the canonical left-to-right, top-to-bottom manner;</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">cast the eyes and follow the lines but linger continually to admire the serifs and the pleasing bowls, so nicely kearned and leaded;</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">cast the eyes and recognize each letter but none of the words;</a> 
<a href="You_have.html">cast the eyes and recognize the words that the letters constitute but avoid recognizing the phrases by continually falling into etymological or personally associative reveries;</a> 
<a href="index.html">cast the eyes and recognize something of the phrases but not the overarching syntax and structure that hooks them together in potentially complex, unnerving ways;</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">read it so that you can repeat each phrase back again but so that you forget each phrase almost immediately thereafter;</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">just read the table of contents; just read the acknowledgments and bibliography and index to see if your name is there;</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">fix on what can be easily chewed as familiar and known.</a>

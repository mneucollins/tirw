<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="Stop_reading.html">You have so far failed to inquire about whether they listened to the whole symphony or watched the movie entire;</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">nor if they heard every note or perceived every object that was photographed, or if they managed to somehow traverse the Tunnel of Love out of sequence.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">With rails gone for guns, the option of not expending the full cartridge is more palpable.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">You have been trained to assemble the story blindfolded in under a minute and sometimes do so for amusement at cocktail parties, being careful not to point it at anyone.</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">But not these fragments, shored against ruin, please.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">I don't keep them oiled up properly.</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">My social life took a sharp turn for the worse after I started contributing to a literary work which uses every word in the English language, some of them more than once. </a>
<a href="index.html">At this rate, one day we'll develop something that can read it.</a>

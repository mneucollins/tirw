<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="Some_countries.html">It seemed we would have to go to a different establishment for each citrus. From the small, carceral structure of our agendas we wiggled for a space of time,</a> 
<a href="Stop_reading.html">only making it as far as a papier-m&acirc;ch&egrave; class peopled by geriatrics and problem teens.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">Reminding ourselves about what we're going to end up as, we end up ending up that way, and don't even enjoy the journey.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">The solution is about ninety percent water.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">Realistically, there's no veering off the well-trodden path, knocking on a door at random, introducing myself,</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">and having one of those expansive philosophical conversations that end in fajitas at the 24-hour place.</a> 
<a href="index.html">I'm going to go where I always go, and you too, or else we'll go someplace else, but with the same body and mindset that can be navigated no more easily than an iceberg or comet.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">It all ends up as the same water under the bridge.</a> 
<a href="You_have.html">Step in the same stream twice. You get soaked.</a>

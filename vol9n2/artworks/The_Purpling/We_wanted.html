<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="Stop_reading.html">We wanted the robot to be happy, too.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">Such a stickler, everything must always be done in order, but then it wishes each person a nice day after each financial transaction is done.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">While others puzzle over the problem of how they can be rude to it, we prefer to play nice.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">Perhaps a parti-colored outfit slipped elastically over the obelisk, over our automatic friend, as we make sure that its sense organs and openings for ventilation are not stifled by the attire?</a> 
<a href="You_have.html">It was the festive season, after all. We ourselves had glitter-spray over our exposed surfaces, were wearing half-masks, and bore kazoos either in our hands or ready in holsters.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">Would the reaction be hesitant laughter, stunned silence, or applause, as we proceeded to the checkout to pay for our cascarones?</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">As we headed out, would three individuals costumed as officers of the law appear at the door?</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">Three individuals with badge numbers, checked out and registered, governed by procedures?</a> 
<a href="index.html">The guise of happiness can't, legally, blanket everything.</a>

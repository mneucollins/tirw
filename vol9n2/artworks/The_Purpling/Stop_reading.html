<a href="index.html">Stop reading and you can keep up appearances by browsing through the search results or by glancing at whatever comments get modded up.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">The apparatus of light and current blunts our honed skills of skim-quick thumb-flipping, but they've got people working on that.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">The house of cards will now have to be moved to special collections, gingerly, where jokers like that one can play at being quiet and morose.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">So much for building a new deck under these circumstances.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">I keep my jacket on pretty much all the time since it's been a bit chilly;</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">I'm not trying to signal that I'm about to take my leave.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">The words here are essentially arranged in the right order, but there's this special section we've got for the oversized words.</a>
<a href="You_have.html">Registration is required for access to these words over here.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">We're using the old version of the card catalog as a scratch disk right now.</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">Burning books was a great improvement over burning illiterate Yugoslavian bards, and burning CDs is going to be even better, at least for those who can't afford to press them.</a>

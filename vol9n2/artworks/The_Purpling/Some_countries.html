<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="You_have.html">Some countries hold elections to decide the meaning of strophes, and women aren't allowed to vote.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">We consider it an intermediate stage that still has its share of problems, but these will be ameliorated when meaning is abolished.</a> 
<a href="index.html">Diversity in the classroom can be a good thing, mentor.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">The relationship between that large, round, chapter-ending typographical mark and menstruation can be clarified by a native of the British Isles pointing out that they just call it a "full stop" over there.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">At one point they just barely mustered enough votes to take the comma out and fell one vote short of deciding to put it back in.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">The away team that was dispatched to explore chapter five was never heard from again.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">We managed to convince the professor that a "culture day" with sizzling innards would not be a good idea, and suggested an outing to the beach instead.</a> 
<a href="Stop_reading.html">Someone in linguistics was embarking on an experiment that would involve finding a bucolic lad who had never even heard of the novel in question,</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">leaving the book near the flock he was tending, and waiting to see what reading he would come up with.</a>

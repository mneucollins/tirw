<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="Some_countries.html">In some regions women, as they jog, wear shorts that display a large word over their ass, a word which sometimes, for reasons unbeknownst to me, is <i>MENTOR.</i></a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">I'd like to, Nestor, but I hardly know her.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">Rather curious that forehead advertising hasn't taken off, but the gimme cap industry has proven itself a ruthless, effective machine.</a> 
<a href="Stop_reading.html">The fans at the game pulled off their shirts, painted their faces green, and scrawled the letters A&nbsp;R&nbsp;M&nbsp;Y on their chests.</a> 
<a href="index.html">One of them went to get a beer from the cooler and caused the group to reenact a George Herbert poem.</a> 
<a href="Living_on.html">That T-shirt and G-string make for perfectly fetching attire &mdash; no need to buy a vowel.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">Every morning I look all over my body in case instructions are neatly tattooed here and there, but you can imagine what I find.</a> 
<a href="It_seemed.html">"So was the concert good, cuties?" "Yeah." "What do the X's on your hands mean?"</a>
<a href="You_have.html">"That means we're minors." "Yeah? Looks like I'd better stick to the chips and salsa."</a>

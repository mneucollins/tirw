<h1><a href="index.html">The Purpling</a></h1>
<h2><a href="http://nickm.com">a poem by Nick Montfort</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="It_seemed.html">Living on the coast is like getting diagnosed in a sawed-off MRI, or whatever they call those things.</a> 
<a href="I_am.html">It's still living, that is &mdash; an intolerable procedure about which almost nothing can be done.</a> 
<a href="Some_countries.html">The waves, which are fictions, lap at the beach, which is another fiction. Usually no woman walks by singing.</a> 
<a href="Stop_reading.html">How many dawns is an integer. Sure, you can secure various certainties in much the same way that an assiduous rock climber loads a new page.</a> 
<a href="We_wanted.html">It would sound awesome if you could get there by hovercraft, but I'm told the ride is not so hot.</a> 
<a href="In_some.html">Better to keep taking air in and pushing it out, using the legs and the fingers for what we've designed them to do.</a> 
<a href="index.html">That's what I find, anyway; it's one of the few things I can really recommend.</a> 
<a href="Cast_the.html">Technical challenges are good for entertainment, which is more than I can say about waging lifelong struggles against bureaucracies, however toothlesss.</a> 
<a href="You_have.html">Find amusement in provoking sessile giants, if that tickles you.</a>

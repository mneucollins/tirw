<i>The dream began in a laboratory.<BR>  
A woman was bending over a faded gray photograph,<BR>
the equipment surrounding her from another era of laboratory time.
<P>
As if I had I clicked on a zoom-in button<BR>
(like those arrows on ubiquitous Internet-situated maps<BR>
of places where I longed to go)<BR>
a clear X-shaped pattern emerged in the center of the photograph.<BR>
Instantly I recognized Rosalind Franklin's famous X-Ray diffraction photograph<BR>
that with such startling elegance described the helical shape of DNA.
<P> 
She turned and tried to speak to me<BR>
but the dream dissolved into another dream.</i></A>

<i>As I read Naval Historian E. B. Potter's biography of Admiral Arleigh Burke,<BR>
saw the familiar patterns of disruption,<BR>
the impact on the Navy of diverting the careers of able men<BR>
was as evident<BR>
as the impact on our culture of diverting the lives of artists.
<P>
I could almost see unseen hands pulling strings<BR>
to make the lives of a Naval officer and his wife<BR> 
difficult.</i></A>

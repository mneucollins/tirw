<i>The other sculpture I have been looking at is "Unconquered II",<BR>
Allan Houser's memorial for the Apache people.<BR>
Beside a photograph of this sculpture<BR>
are the words that begin Sioux Chief Yellow Hawk's morning prayer:
<P>
"Great Spirit<BR>

Whose voice I hear in the winds<BR>

Hear me"
<P>
Allan Houser's father was with the Warm Springs Chiricahuas<BR>
when Geronimo surrendered to the U.S. Army.<BR> 
When 1200 Chiricahuas were put on cattle cars and sent to prisons in Florida,<BR>
his father was with them.<BR>
In a prison camp in Alabama, where the surviving members of the tribe were shunted,<BR>
his mother was born in captivity <BR>
When the last of the Chircahuas were sent to Fort Sill,<BR>
his parents were with them.<BR>
And there they remained captive for twenty-three years. 
<P>
In 1914 when they were finally freed,<BR> 
Allan Houser was the first child born out of captivity.</i></A>

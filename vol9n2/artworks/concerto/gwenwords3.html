<A HREF="gwen6.html" target="_top"><i>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.<BR>
In my mind, a disturbing eugenics-laden speech played<BR>
and replayed,<BR>
its words spoken by the man who now presided over a laboratory<BR> 
where long ago the idea of breeding human beings was nurtured.
<P>
In the dream, I was in a room<BR>
where the records of  everyone in the country<BR>
were stored on silent supercomputers.<BR>
The doors were guarded by uniformed sentries;<BR> 
a group of people were gathered around a monitor.
<P>
On the screen, a complex visual came slowly into focus.<BR>
I saw my name and beside it,<BR>
details of meetings with past boyfriends,<BR>
known, I thought, only to me.</i></A>

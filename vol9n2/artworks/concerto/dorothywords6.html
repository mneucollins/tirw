<i>In the dream, first Hitler,<BR>
painting watercolor postcards in a small room,<BR>
an unstable young man,<BR>
who had been attacked with mustard gas in the first World War,<BR>
and then -- this was really strange -- another man who looked like him<BR> 
took his place. He had the cold eyes of a psychopath<BR> 
from an ancient order.<BR>
<P>
In nightmare sequence, I saw the black gates of Auschwitz open.<BR>
The mass murder of the Jewish people of Europe.<BR>
The people of the world who turned their backs on what was happening.<BR>
<P>
And then the dream shifted.<BR> 
It was 1946. Germany was in ruins.</i></A>

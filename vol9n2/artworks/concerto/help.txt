The entire work is compressed in concerto_IRW_08.zip 
This file contains 179 files:
170 .html files
8 image files
and a copy of these instructions: help.txt  

The image files (that will need to be loaded in binary mode if they are 
uploaded to the Internet)  are:

Note that the .jpg and .JPG files were created with different software. 
The capitalization differences should not be changed as they are keyed exactly 
to the files that call these images.

<i>I Remember Princess Diana walking through the landmine fields in Angola. 
<P>
The photographs of Diana beside the victims of landmines<BR>
were an unforgettable reminder that the Pentagon's insistence<BR>
on a weapon that wounds and kills thousands of woman and children<BR>
as well as soldiers in our own Armed Forces<BR>
is untenable.
<P>
In the summer of 1997, she visited landmine survivors in Bosnia.
<P>
A few weeks later she was dead.</i></A>

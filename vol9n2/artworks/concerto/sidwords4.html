<A HREF="sid1a.html" target="_top">
<i>I am very happy to be a curator in these times<BR>
when bringing the spirit of art and the people who create it to a wider public<BR>
is particularly important. For me, that is my life's work. 
<P> 
And yet I am troubled by what happened to Robert Blackburn.<BR>  
I speak out of turn.<BR>
He himself was devoted to his work at the Printmaking Workshop he founded.<BR>
He was enormously influential in introducing the techniques of printmaking<BR>
to so many other artists.
<P>
Yet.... And I am thinking about this because I have been looking at such patterns --<BR>
how the careers of artists are diverted --<BR>
I would have wished for him a life where his own work<BR>
was as equally celebrated as the workshop<BR>
that in the spirit of helping other artists,<BR>
he founded and nurtured throughout his life.</i></A>

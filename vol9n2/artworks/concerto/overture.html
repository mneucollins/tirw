<i>I dreamed of rooms of surveillance
where subjected to the yoke of artificial intelligence
all our words and deeds are collected by machines.
<P>
where the records of everyone in the country
were stored on silent supercomputers.
The doors were guarded by uniformed sentries;
a group of people were gathered around a monitor.
<P>
On the screen, a complex visual came slowly into focus.
I saw my name and beside it,
details of meetings with past boyfriends,
known, I thought, only to me.</i></A>

<i>Code. Churning relentlessly through the beauty of our lives.
    Extracting phrases read by people,
    who, interfering with the lives of their fellow man,
    squander the precious moments
    of their own once-free lives.</i></A>

<i>I speak with sorrow.
My sorrow. The sorrow of many others.
The spiritual healing that we seek so difficult
knowing that our every thought and word and deed is observed.
<P>
If there is comfort left in my invaded soul,
I share it with all who have walked the paths that I have walked.</i></A>

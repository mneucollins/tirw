<i>Otto Ambros, a Director of I.G. Farben -- the company<BR>
that had a major role producing the extermination gas used at Auschwitz --<BR>
was convicted of slavery and mass murder at the N&uuml;rnberg trials. 
<BR>
Eight years was a surprisingly lenient sentence<BR>
for the murder of  hundreds of thousands of Jews,<BR>
yet it was commuted to only 3 years.<BR>
Then, with the help of US Military Intelligence<BR>
and the Central Intelligence Agency,<BR>
he was hired as a consultant by the US Army Chemical Corps,<BR>
by Dow Chemical Company,<BR>
 and by WR Grace Chair, J. Peter Grace.
<P>
Ambros was not the only enemy scientist brought to this country<BR>
by US Military Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency.<BR>
Members of these agencies brought Nazi scientists,<BR> 
who worked slaves to their death<BR>
in the concentration camps where the V-2 rockets were built,<BR>
to the United States<BR>
to direct our Space Program. </i></A>

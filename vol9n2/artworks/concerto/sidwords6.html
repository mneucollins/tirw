<A HREF="sid7.html" target="_top">
<i>Margaret Mitchell's family were Confederate soldiers.<BR>
They also fought the British in the Revolutionary War<BR>
and the Irish uprisings.
<P>
Her Irish Catholic Mother was president of a suffragette group.<BR>
Her Father's family was descended from the Huguenots,<BR>
many of whom came to this country to escape persecution by Catholics.<BR> 
The terrible circle of religious persecution continued<BR> 
in 19th century prejudice against Irish Catholic immigrants. 
<P>
And then something else I hadn't known,<BR> 
that Margaret Mitchell had raised money for World War II,<BR>
that she had funded a scholarship for African American medical students,<BR>
that she supported the integration of the Atlanta Police Department.
<P>
She was run down only three blocks from her home.</i></A>

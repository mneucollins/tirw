Poet Jose Marti chained in a Cuban prison by the Spanish government.<BR>
A century later, poet Heberto Padilla under house arrest in Castro's Cuba.

The means to secretly harm artists and activists,<BR>

could be used by many Governments <BR>
when covert weapons leave no tangible evidence, <BR>
and there is no public outcry.</i></A>

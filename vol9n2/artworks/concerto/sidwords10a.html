<blockquote>
<i>In 1961, writer Ernest Hemingway went to the Mayo clinic under an assumed name<BR>
because he was depressed and suicidal.<BR>
Although FBI records now confirm that Hemingway was under surveillance,<BR>
he was having difficulty convincing his friends and family<BR>
that the FBI was stalking him.<BR>
In a chilling incident of collaborative FBI and medical profession gang stalking,<BR>
a psychiatrist at the clinic contacted the FBI<BR>
and then told Hemingway that the FBI knew he had registered under an assumed name.<BR>
A few months later Ernest Hemingway committed suicide. 
<P>
There are indications that the lives and careers of artists<BR>
have been under observation, for centuries -- the lives of artists<BR>
curtailed by inquisitioner murderers;<BR>
the  careers of artists diverted.<BR>
In Italy, Masaccio, one of the first Renaissance artists to paint explicit nudes,<BR>
died at age 26 of suspected poisoning. 
<P>
In America, the CIA's covert Cold War  funding of certain artists and writers<BR>
controlled the arts to favor work  that was not regional in subject matter<BR>
 and did not criticize American society.

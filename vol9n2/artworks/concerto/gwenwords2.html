And suddenly I was looking down on Cold Spring Harbor.<BR>
At first I thought it was Woods Hole where I once spent a summer<BR>
(another place where the coastline of the deep blue Atlantic Ocean <BR>
is ringed by bioscience laboratories)<BR> 
but (from an image I had seen on the Internet)<BR> 
I recognized the pink-arched central facade<BR> 
of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Library,<BR>
the Grace Auditorium, the endless laboratories<BR>
housed in clapboard houses and old mansions.<BR>
It was late afternoon and, as if haunted by the dark eugenics past<BR>
of the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor,<BR>
shadows surrounded the buildings.</i></A>

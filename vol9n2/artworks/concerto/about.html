<B>About <i>Concerto for Narrative Data</i></B></A>
<P>
It wasn't too long after in <i>Revelations of Secret Surveillance</i> I<BR>
criticized invasive mind-body control research that I took a very minor<BR>
fall while cross country skiing and suffered months of pain and a return<BR>
to crutches. At times the pain was so bad that I imagined that I was being<BR>
virtually tortured. In the winter and early Spring of 2005, from this pain<BR>
began the elegiac tone that pervades <i>Concerto for Narrative Data</i>.  
<P>
On the other side of the railroad tracks, behind the house where I grew up<BR>
in Winchester, Massachusetts, was the Aberjona River, the river of <i>A Civil<BR>
Action</i> that, polluted by WR Grace and other companies, flows through the<BR>
neighboring town of Woburn.
<P>
The mood of <i>Concerto</i> was intensified by my finding of an Internet copy<BR>
of a directive from Nazi Chemist Otto Ambros, who, despite being convicted of<BR>
war crimes at Auschwitz, was hired as a consultant by WR Grace company and<BR>
the US Army Chemical Corps. In the memo, Ambros orders that the concentration<BR>
camp inmates, whom he worked to death, be flogged out of sight of free workers.<BR>
I saw it as a metaphor for the use of covert strategies and technologies to<BR>
hurt people in ways that could not be witnessed.
<P>
In the fictional voices of six artists and writers, <i>Concerto for Narrative<BR>
Data</i>, a web work that could also be performed, describes a relationship<BR>
between covert surveillance, technologies -- developed by the Department of<BR>
Defense and intelligence agency-funded researchers -- and interference in the<BR>
lives of artists, activists, athletes, soldiers, leaders and many other people. 
<P>
Written for an ensemble or "concertare", <i>Concerto</i>, ("concerto" in the<BR>
early music concertato/concerto tradition which is different from<BR>
classical/contemporary usage) is interfaced with a contrapuntal score in which<BR>
the voices parallel each other and the user's coactive choices determine the<BR>
flow of the narrative information. The voices are scibe, a computer artist who<BR>
walks with crutches; Gwen, a writer and environmental activist; Dorothy,<BR>
a painter who came of age in World War II; Sid, a curator; Cassie, an Irish<BR>
American poet; and Archie, a Chicano performance artist.
<P>
The work can be experienced by selecting links anywhere in the <i>concertare</i><BR>
 -- a diffuse six-voice interface in which the soloists and ensemble come together<BR>
and alternate, resulting in an accumulation of narrative information. After a link<BR>
is selected from the <i>concertare</i>, the reader can either return to the <i>concertare</i><BR>
(clicking on <A HREF="voices3.html" target="_top">"<i>concertare</i>"</A> brings up the animated version;<BR>
clicking on <A HREF="interface.html" target="_top">"<i>Concerto for Narrative Data</i>"</A> returns to a static interface)<BR>
or, by clicking on the space bar below the text, follow the words of an individual<BR>
voice.
<P>
<i>Concerto</i> can be thought of as hyperpoetry or as a score in the Fluxus<BR>
tradition, such as a John Cage score, where, if it were performed, interpretation<BR>
is partially determined by the performers. 
<P>
The interface for <i>Concerto for Narrative Data</i> is a variation of the narrative<BR>
data structure interface that I developed in 1991 for <i>Wasting Time, A Narrative<BR>
Data Structure</i> ("After the Book", <i>Perforations 3</i>, Summer, 1992)
<P>
The photograph on the cover page (taken by my mother Barbara Lillard Powers) is<BR>
a World War II US Army training camp. Located in Texas, Camp Hulen is the place<BR>
where I was conceived when my father was stationed there in 1941. When I first used<BR>
a photo of Camp Hulen in <i>Revelations of Secret Surveillance</i>, I did not know<BR>
that that later in the War, while my father was fighting on the German front, Camp<BR>
Hulen was used to house Nazi prisoners of war. Thus the photo, first used because it<BR>
represented the significance of being born in 1942, also represents the initially<BR>
unseen shadows of World War II that pervade the narrative.

<B><i>"Beautiful morning.  Blank canvas."</i></B> 
<P>
The concerto opens with the voice of painter<BR>
Dorothy Abrona McCrae, whose first husband was killed<BR>
on the Pacific Front in the Second World War.  
<P>
Dorothy begins a painting in which she sets four actress heroines<BR>
in the center of the canvas. Using a Renaissance background:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<i>"sandstone-colored columns and arches<BR>
like those that Quattrocento painters created in the magical landscapes<BR>
that surround their resonant Biblical narratives"</i>  </FONT>
<P>
she suggests a parallel with the lives of  the early film stars - such as<BR>
Jean Harlow, Rudolph Valentino, and Veronica Lake -- and the lives of <BR>
Renaissance painters, such as Pietro Perugino, some of whose panels in <BR>
the Sistine Chapel were painted over by Michelangelo by commission from<BR>
the Medici Pope Clement VII, such as Masaccio -- painter of the graphic nude<BR>
figures in <i>Expulsion from the Garden of Eden</i> --  who died at age 26.
<P>
The four actresses in the center of Dorothy's painting are Grace Kelly,<BR>
who gave up acting when she became the Princess of Monaco, supported<BR>
the arts, and died when her car went off a road in Monaco; Myrna Loy<BR>
who was on Hitler's blacklist for criticizing him and found it difficult<BR>
to get roles after she criticized Senator Joseph McCarthy; Audrey Hepburn,<BR>
who carried messages for the Resistance in occupied Holland; and Carole<BR>
Lombard, who was killed in a plane crash after selling a record number<BR>
of war bonds.
<P>
From the death of Carole Lombard, Dorothy moves to the death of actor and poet<BR>
Audie Murphy. The most decorated soldier in World War II, he also had the<BR>
courage to speak out about Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Audie Murphy was<BR>
killed in a plane crash on Memorial Day Weekend.
<P>
Searching for parallel histories in the stories of the men with whom her<BR>
first husband served, Dorothy then looks at the life of a WWII Naval hero,<BR> 
Arleigh Burke. She reads a biography of Burke and is surprised by the appearance<BR>
of a manipulation of his life and career that is similar to what she has been<BR>
seeing in the lives of artists.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<i>"I could almost see unseen hands pulling strings<BR>
to make the lives of a Naval officer and his wife<BR>
difficult."</i>
</FONT>
<P>
The finale of Dorothy's part is a recollected dream sequence: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"The nightmare continued. Like a faded postwar newsreel, <BR>
fast forwarded into the twenty-first century on a VCR of uncertain origin.<BR>
I was not sure whether I was awake or still asleep.<BR>
Dreaming or remembering, I saw millions of people.<BR>
Like the people I had seen in the 1940's, <BR>
their backs were turned to what was happening.
<P>
Then the dream shifted,<BR>
and all across our country, people turned to confront the enemy.
<P>
When I woke up, the sun was shining.<BR>
I went to my studio and began to paint." </i>

<B>Sid Seibelman is  a curator working on a book about the lives of artists.</B><BR>
He is Jewish, and he fought on the Italian Front in World War II.<BR>
He and Dorothy were married when they were both in their eighties. 
<P>
Sid opens his part by speaking of Chiricahua Apache sculptor<BR>
Allan Houser's <i>Morning Prayer</i> that so eloquently expresses<BR>
the significance of the beginning of each day. Allan Houser's<BR>
father had been imprisoned by the US Government; his mother was<BR>
born in captivity.
<P>
Sid speaks of Frida Kahlo, who, although severely hindered by a life<BR>
of pain, created an extraordinary body of work. He describes her prophetic of<BR>
neuro-interference self portrait <i>Diego on my Mind</i>; her death a<BR>
few days after participating in a demonstration against CIA involvement<BR>
in Guatemala. 
<P>
He looks at diversions and silencing in the lives of artists.<BR> 
For instance, the African American artist Robert Blackburn devoted his life<BR> 
to working with other artists in the printmaking workshop which he founded,<BR>
but as a result had less time for his own work; Alice Austen's 8,000<BR>
photographs, particularly her photographs of women together, are mainly<BR>
confined to a museum in the house she had to sell because of poverty.
<P>
He speaks of Margaret Mitchell, the writer of Southern historical<BR>
fiction who died when she was run down a few blocks from her home,<BR>
and of the hard luck that stalked the interracial cast of the movie<BR>
version of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>.
<P>
Clark Gable lost his wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash.<BR>
Hattie McDaniel, the first African American to win an Academy<BR>
Award, was only 57 years old when she died.<BR>
Leslie Howard was killed when the Nazis attacked the plane<BR>
he was on, although British Intelligence knew in advance<BR>
that the plane was going to be attacked. Vivien Leigh contracted<BR>
tuberculosis. Screenplay writer Sidney Howard was crushed by a tractor.<BR>
Butterfly McQueen found it difficult to get work as an actress,<BR>
and she died of burns after a fire at her home.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"And then something else I hadn't known,<BR>
that Margaret Mitchell had raised money for World War II,<BR>
that she had funded a scholarship for African American medical students,<BR>
that she supported the integration of the Atlanta Police Department.
<P>
She was run down only three blocks from her home."</i> 
</FONT>
<P>
Of the death of choreographer/dancer Arnie Zane, from AIDS,<BR>
Sid says:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<i>"The losses to our culture are relentless.<BR>
I set them forth not to imply that tragedy is the fate of every artist,<BR>
but rather because I think that if they are documented,<BR>
it will become clear that there are patterns,<BR>
that the losses are beyond coincidence."</i>
</FONT>
<P>
Sid's part concludes with a return to the work and life of Allan Houser,<BR>
and to <i>Unconquered II</i>, his sculptured memorial for the Apache people.<BR>
Allan Houser was the first child born out of captivity after the<BR>
Warm Springs Chiricahua Apaches were imprisoned.

</pre>
 <B>Hyperfiction writer and environmental activist, Gwen</B> begins her part<BR>
with a dream about Rosalind Franklin, whose work <BR>
 -- essential in the unraveling of the structure of DNA --<BR>
was continually overlooked.  
<P>
Perhaps because of the surprising eugenics views expressed by<BR>
James D. Watson, the man who with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins<BR>
received the Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA,<BR>
Gwen's dream takes her to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,<BR>
where Watson is now head of what was once a notorious haven for<BR>
eugenics. And then, her dream sequence moves to an underground<BR>
computer system that houses a national breeding system, like that<BR>
once proposed by Harvard eugenicist Earnest Hooton.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"In the dream, I was in a room<BR>
where the records of everyone in the country<BR>
were stored on silent supercomputers.<BR>
The doors were guarded by uniformed sentries;<BR>
a group of people were gathered around a monitor.
<P> 
On the screen, a complex visual came slowly into focus.<BR>
I saw my name and beside it,<BR>
details of meetings with past boyfriends,<BR>
known, I thought, only to me."</i>
</FONT>
<P>
In the closing lexias, Gwen looks at ways that brain interference<BR>
technologies could be used to hinder the work of creators, and she places<BR>
this in the context of the virtual imprisonment of the creative community.<BR> 
She speaks of the lives of scientist Norbert Wiener, who refused to do<BR>
Defense work after 1946 and began to have trouble remembering; of<BR>
painter/philosopher Mu Xin, who was imprisoned by the Chinese communists;<BR>
and of Japanese American painter Chiura Obata, who was interned in<BR>
America during World War II.  
<P>
Gwen's part closes with writer and environmental activist John Muir, who did<BR>
so much to conserve wilderness but died of pneumonia shortly after he lost the<BR>
battle to save Hetch Hetchy Valley:
<P>
She speaks of the dual tragedies of the loss of the Hetch Hetchy Valley,<BR>
and the death of John Muir but nevertheless remembers the legacy of his<BR>
life and work:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"He lived the life that he wrote, walking the woods.<BR>
drawing, writing every detail of the forest.
<P>
He left us the gift of eternal landscape<BR>
forever free and open."</i> 
</FONT>
<pre>


</pre>
<B>Chicano performance artist Archie looks at systems of life<BR>
interference as a whole.</B> He begins by quoting a memo from<BR>
Nazi Scientist, Otto Ambros -- former Chief of the Chemical Warfare<BR>
Committee of the German Ministry of Armaments and War Production,<BR>
a manager at Auschwitz, who after being convicted of slavery and mass<BR> 
murder was brought to this country as a consultant by Peter Grace,<BR> 
Dow Chemical Company, and the US Army Chemical Corps.  
<P>
In the memo Ambros recommends flogging Auschwitz worker inmates<BR> 
inside the concentration camp so as not to impact the morale<BR> 
of the other workers.
<P>
Archie speaks of how governments on all sides of the political<BR>
spectrum persecute artists:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"Poet Jose Marti chained in a Cuban prison by the Spanish government. 

<P>

A century later, poet Heberto Padilla under house arrest in Castro's Cuba."</i>
</FONT>
<P> 
He suggests the potential for virtually imprisoning artists<BR>
using covert technologies and systematic life interference.
<P>
He calls attention to the documented existence of covert technologies --<BR> 
weather interference and brain interference to control and cause pain; <BR>
technologies such as remote control guidance systems to commit murders<BR>
and to cause disabling events that are seemingly accidents -- and he emphasizes<BR>
that it is not necessary to prove that they are actually being used against<BR>
civilians, in order to legislate the use of these technologies as weapons<BR>
against civilians. 
<P>
Archie quotes the words of African American<BR>
Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who suffered from multiple sclerosis<BR>
and died of leukemia and pneumonia:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"The majority of the American people still believe<BR>
that every single individual in this country<BR>
is entitled to just as much respect, just as much dignity,<BR>
as every other individual."</i> 
</FONT>
<pre>


</pre>
<B>New media artist scibe, a skier, skater, and tennis player<BR>
before she was crippled, opens her part with a dream sequence about<BR> 
NSA-like databanks that monitor all activity of human beings.</B><BR>
She calls on the spirit of experimental writer Italo Calvino, who told<BR>
stories in camp at night while fighting with the Italian Resistance.
<P>
Then she herself speaks:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"I survived a terrible accident.<BR>
I walk with crutches.<BR>
Now battle scarred, observing systems that others<BR>
do not observe,<BR>
I am not afraid to speak.
<P> 
This is a story of the manifestations of covert revenge.
<P>
A call for the shared strength to acknowledge the presence<BR>
of attacks on civilians with intelligence agency technologies,<BR>
the courage to confront them."</i>
</FONT>
<P>
scibe  looks at the lives of skiers and skaters --<BR>
Gretchen Fraser, The Owen family, Dick Buek, Jimmy Griffith.<BR>
Reminding the audience that the US Army 10th Mountain Division of skiers,<BR>
snowshoers, and mountaineers won an important battle against the Nazi<BR>
Gebirgsjager, the "mountain hunters" that the Germans thought were<BR>
invincible, she suggests a possible connection with life interference<BR>
and deaths of our athletes and World War II history.  
<P>
She concludes by returning to the dream that began her part. <BR>
Perhaps because she has been reading about mind-body control technologies<BR>
and sees the potential for controlling athlete's bodies,<BR> 
scibe dreams of a wireless computer system that records the brain waves<BR>
of the legendary tennis champion Helen Wills. Symbolically, this dream<BR> 
represents the triumph of athletes over the potential use of such systems:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"Her ability to anticipate the moves of her opponents.<BR>
Stolen by researchers and machines. 
<P>
But she, winner of Wimbledon, stands tall,<BR>
wearing white on the green grass courts. 
<P>
Remembered forever for her grace and skill. "</i>
</FONT>
<pre>


</pre>
<B>The poet Cassie begins with the lives of Brian Piccalo and<BR>
Gayle Sayers:</B> <FONT SIZE=-1>
<i>"...the first African American and white<BR>
teammates to room together in the National Football League.<BR>
in a story where one of the heroes battled injuries throughout his career,<BR>
and the other was dead of cancer at age twenty-six."</i></FONT>
<P>
She speaks of the loss to everyone when our heroes and heroines are killed:<BR>
Pittsburgh Pirates Outfielder Roberto Clemente who died in a plane crash<BR>
when he was taking food and supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua;<BR>
Britain's Princess Diana, who died after advocating an end to landmines.
<P>
Cassie points to a system where Intelligence agencies from different<BR>
countries do each other's dirty work -- spying on civilians in each<BR>
other's countries and then, as the US and Great Britain do, sharing<BR>
the intelligence. Looking at the deaths of musicians, she wonders if that<BR>
extends to assassination.
<P>
She speaks of the School of the Americas, (now the Western Hemisphere<BR>
Institute for Security Cooperation) where the US military trains Latin<BR> 
American terrorists, of the role of graduates from this school<BR>
in the death of Archbishop Romero,<BR>
murdered while conducting Mass in a chapel in El Salvador,<BR>
shortly after he asked the military to stop the killing. 
<P>
Cassie looks at the potential for new technologies -- such as brain<BR>
interference technologies that can disrupt work and cause pain --<BR> 
to be used against civilians, and she expresses a plea for a coming<BR>
together of people of different political outlooks to fight interference<BR>
with our lives and environment:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"Who among us believes that scientists have the right<BR>
    to experiment on people without their consent?
<P>
    To use human beings as guinea pigs<BR>
    because of their world view, beliefs, ways of expression,<BR>
    lifestyles or heredity --<BR>
    causing them pain, ruining their lives,<BR>
    taking away their freedoms."</i> </FONT>
<P> 
She closes with the dream sequence from <i>Ask for Sanctuary</i>:  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<i>"I dreamed that all around the world --<BR>
people who work for our communities,<BR>
churches, people who speak for peace,<BR>
advocates for people and human rights,<BR>
advocates for animals, advocates for the environment,<BR>
scientists, doctors, psychiatrists, inventors, the media<BR>
writers, musicians, dancers, artists of all kinds,<BR>
veterans, unions, statesmen and women, intelligence agents,<BR>
and many others -- came together to expose the systems of persecution.
<P>
I heard their words.<BR>
And in the morning when I awoke<BR>
all around the world, in every nation,<BR>
the bells in the towns and the cities were ringing for freedom and peace."</i>

Jonathan D. Moreno, <i>Mind Wars, Brain Research and National Defense</i>,<BR>
NY, NY, Washington, DC: Dana Press, 2006.<BR>
An overview of so-called "non-lethal" weapons developed by the US<BR>
Department of Defense, including those developed to cause pain.<BR>
Moreno does not adequately discuss the potential for technologies that<BR>
allow access to the brain to be used to control human minds in order to<BR>
cause pain. However, in a section entitled "No Pain No Gain", (pp. 153-154)<BR>
he documents the ADS ("active-denial" system) that uses microwave beams to<BR>
induce pain, as well as the use of nociceptor stimulation using pulsed energy<BR>
projectiles (PEPS) to cause severe pain. 
<P>
In a chilling segment, Moreno suggests that calling human experiments<BR> 
"field trials", in order to circumvent human experiment ethics in the<BR>
testing of such pain inducing nonlethal weapons is acceptable, and he notes<BR>
that seemingly the military considers that if doctors are not in charge<BR>
such tests could be considered a "field trial" rather than a human<BR>
experiment. Speaking of cold war tests that in which soldiers and sailors were<BR> 
purposefully exposed to Atomic bomb and chemical nerve agents, he writes:<BR>
"One can argue whether there was deliberate duplicity on the part of<BR> 
military officials in these cases or not, but I don't think so.  In fact,<BR> 
it's often not easy to tell the difference between developing a new<BR>
device or training for a new situation and conducting a human experiment." <BR>
(p. 157)
<P>
The need to respond to justification of such a terrible disregard of human<BR>
rights, was one of the reasons that <i>Concerto for Narrative Data</i> was begun.

Alexander details the use of high-power ultrasound weapons on humans<BR>
and the built environment. These weapons, developed in the US<BR>
by Scientific Applications and Research Associates (SARA) in California,<BR>
among others, have the capacity to cause pain, to cause inattention,<BR>
sleepiness, and fatigue, to disrupt mental reasoning.  PPS (Pulsed Periodic<BR>
Stimuli) weapons also developed at SARA according to Alexander, are capable<BR>
of causing neurophysiological distress and perceptual disorientation.

She postulates that a cowardly desire to control opposing generals might have<BR>
been the cover for the research and testing of these technologies on the<BR>
creative community, but that the covert use of these technologies on artists<BR>
is actually meant to control the work of artists and writers in the way that<BR>

The <A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/gunterandgwen/resources.html" target="_top">
Resource Pages</A> for <i>Revelations of Secret Surveillance</i> provide background<BR>
material on mind and mind body control technologies.
<P>
Note that some of these technologies could have positive uses, but the<BR>
ramifications of their uses have not adequately been discussed. Public dialogue,<BR>
legislated limitation of use, and an enforceable requirement of informed consent<BR>
(for instance for mind invasive technologies) would do much to validate<BR>
neuroscience research that is not invasive and may be of benefit. For instance,<BR>
although there may be instances where neural implants could help people with<BR>
disabilities, to this author, an artist with a disability, it appears that people<BR>
with disabilities are, in some cases, being used as an excuse to develop very<BR>
invasive research and that neither the public nor the disability community are<BR>
being adequately informed of the dangers of the technologies being developed,<BR>
of alternative approaches, or of the potential military uses of these<BR>
technologies on the soldiers in our own Armed Forces.
<P>
Yet there is hope that if the public is adequately informed and protections<BR>
are in place, in the frontiers of neuroscience research there may indeed be<BR>
benefits for the disability community and for many others.
<P>
The laboratories and institutions that have and or are developing mind invasive<BR>
technologies include the US National Institute of Mental Health, the Central<BR>
Intelligence Agency, US Defense Advanced Projects Agency, (DARPA) the National<BR>

Covert technologies to cause automobile accidents were used in this country by<BR>
British Security Coordination (BSC) during World War II and are likely to have<BR>
been adopted by other Intelligence agencies, such as the OSS (later the CIA) that<BR>
had close ties with BSC. Among the possible methods for staging accidents is the<BR>
use of remote control (RC) to subtly control vehicles. RC research and development<BR> 
in this country includes Tesla's radio controlled boat, MIT-developed WWII<BR>
guidance systems; the US Navy's WWII TDR-1 Assault Drone and the US Air Force<BR>
Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  During World War II Nazi scientists<BR>
developed and produced remote controlled demolition tank units

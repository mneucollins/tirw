<blockquote> 
<A HREF="voices4.html" target="_top">
<i>The nightmare continued. Like a faded postwar newsreel,<BR>
fastforwarded into the twenty-first century on a VCR of uncertain origin.<BR>
I was not sure whether I was awake or still asleep.<BR>
Dreaming or remembering, I saw millions of people.<BR>
Like the people I had seen in the 1940's,<BR>
their backs were turned to what was happening.
<P>
Then the dream shifted,<BR>
and all across our country, people turned to confront the enemy.
<P>
When I woke up, the sun was shining.<BR>
I went to my studio and began to paint.</i></A>

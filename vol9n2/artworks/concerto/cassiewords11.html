<i>In a time where intelligence agents of many countries<BR>
are not accountable to the citizens of the world for their actions,<BR>
the terrible impact of circumventing laws intended to protect citizens<BR>
is demonstrated by the training of Central American terrorists<BR>
by our own US Army;<BR> 
is demonstrated by the US Intelligence agency information sharing<BR>
with informants from Central American dictatorships<BR>
that contributed to the persecution of the church-based Sanctuary movement.<BR>

Remember
<P>
Archbishop Oscar Romero who spoke for an end to the violence in El Salvador.<BR> 
Killed while conducting Mass.
<P>
Graduates of the U.S. Army's School of the Americas<BR>
were among the men involved in his assassination.</i></A>

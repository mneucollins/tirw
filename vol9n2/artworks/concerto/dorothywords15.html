<i>The man I married as the war began<BR>
was killed in the Pacific.  We never had much time together.<BR>
In the time that we had, something always happened to keep us apart.
<P>
I searched for parallel histories<BR>
in the stories of the men with whom he served.
<P>
Admiral Arleigh Burke. The picture of his life,<BR>
unexpected. The things that happened to him,<BR>
like the emerging evidence of control of artist's lives.<BR>  
Not only the big things -- how his career seemed continually diverted,<BR>
where he was led in his final years -- <BR>
but also the small things.<BR> 
The pattern of relentless life interference.</i></A>

<i>In a terrible metaphor for a system developed<BR>
to torture people unseen,<BR> 
while he was Operations Manager at Auschwitz,<BR>
Otto Ambros issued a directive in which he addressed the public whipping<BR>
of the people he worked to death on the Auschwitz construction site.
<P>
The flogging in view of the free workers was demoralizing, he pointed out.
<P>
He ordered that the prisoners be whipped inside the concentration camp,<BR>
out of sight of the free workers.</A>

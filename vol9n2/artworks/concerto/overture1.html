<i>In the dream I was walking with Norbert Wiener.
We were trying to find his house because he couldn't remember where it was.
As we walked around in circles, he told me of his decision
not to work on weapons-related research.
'It was 1946', he said.
<P>
I was worried about why he was having trouble remembering.
I wanted to ask him if he knew that the FBI was watching him.
<P>
But it was only a dream.
And the man who created the word "cybernetics" was gone.</i>

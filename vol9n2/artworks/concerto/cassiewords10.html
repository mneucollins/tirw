<i>Diana knew that she was being stalked. I know what her life was like,<BR>
the feeling that you are stared at in every intimate moment.
<P>
The musicians also. Their lives like hers.  Like mine.<BR> 
Lived in the shadow of relentless observation.<BR>
<P>
In a time where intelligence agents of many countries<BR>
are not accountable to the citizens of the world for their actions,<BR>

remember the Irish musicians excluded from British territory in the 14th century.<BR>

Remember the Irish musicians and artists who were executed by Queen Elizabeth I. <BR>
<P>
John Lennon from Liverpool,<BR>
who spoke also for Ireland, the birthplace of his grandparents,<BR>
died in New York City. 
<P>
Jimi Hendrix and Mama Cass died in London.

<i>Remember Barbara Jordan.

she suffered pain, loss of motion, and career interference from multiple sclerosis.<BR>
She died of leukemia and pneumonia.

In the words of African American Congresswoman Barbara Jordan:
<P>
"The majority of the American people still believe<BR>
  that every single individual in this country<BR>
is entitled to just as much respect, just as much dignity,<BR>
 as every other individual."</i></A>

<A HREF="sid2.html" target="_top">
<i>Alice Austen<BR> 
was a dedicated photographer of remarkable vision and technical skill,<BR>
who recorded half a century in over 8,000 photographs,<BR> 
each one a masterpiece of narrative and visual clarity.
<P>
She lived on Staten island and photographed the boats going in and out the Narrows,<BR>
the lives of her family and friends,<BR>
early automobiles, tickertape parades for returning heroes,<BR>
the working people of New York City, Central Park, New York City in transition<BR>
and the lives of women who lived together.<BR>
For over 30 years, she lived with Gertrude Amelia Tate.<BR>
But Alice Austen's photographs of women together are rarely exhibited.
<P>
Alice Austen lost all her money in the Depression, and then she lost her house<BR>
and her belongings. Finally, she was reduced to living in the poor house.<BR>
Her work was discovered in 1951 and exhibited in the Richmondtown museum.<BR>
She died less than a year later.<BR>
There is an Alice Austen Museum in the home she was forced to sell on Staten Island.<BR>
But if there has been a major museum retrospective of her work,<BR>
I am not aware of it.
<P>
It seems that like many other artists, particularly women,<BR> 
Alice Austen's work is under house arrest.</i></A>

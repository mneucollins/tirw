<A HREF="sid5.html" target="_top">
<i>Centuries ago in Italy,<BR>
Masaccio, one of the first Renaissance artists to paint explicit nudes,<BR>
died at age 26 of suspected poisoning,<BR>
and Botticelli was convinced to burn his secular work<BR>
in Savonarola's bonfire.
<P>
Here, while the FBI stalked artists and writers  -- including<BR>
Georgia O'Keeffe, William Faulkner,<BR>
Ernest Hemingway, Alexander Calder, <BR>
Carl Sandburg, Lillian Hellman, James Baldwin,<BR>
Marianne Moore, Allen Ginsberg, Muriel Rukeyser,<BR>
Langston Hughes and James Thurber -- <BR>
the CIA's covert Cold War funding of certain artists and writers<BR>
controlled the arts<BR>
to make sure that art that was regional in subject matter was not seen;<BR>
to promote art that portrayed America in a favorable light.
<P>
I do not intend at this point to attach specific blame to any one entity,<BR>
but rather to make the case that there is a problem<BR> 
that needs to be investigated.</i></A>

<i>During World War II, in occupied Norway, Norwegian skiers<BR>
destroyed a heavy water facility that could have given the Hitler the atomic bomb.
<P> 
 In the mountains of Italy, the legendary US Army 10th Mountain Division<BR>
-- skiers, mountaineers, and snowshoers -- <BR>
forced the surrender of Nazi troops<BR>
in a battle that began on February 18, 1945.
<P> 
Remembering 
<P>
Norwegian American Gretchen Fraser, a skier from the state of Washington.
<P>
In 1948 at the  first Winter Olympics after the Second World War,<BR>
she had the best time in the first run of the slalom.<BR>
But at the starting gate waiting to begin her second run,<BR> 
the telephone linking the top of the course to the finish<BR>
failed. She waited seventeen eternal minutes in the cold,<BR>
still won the race. 
<P>
Gretchen Fraser, the first American woman to win Olympic Gold in skiing,<BR>
taught skiing to war veterans with disabilities.<BR>
She died on February 17, 1994<BR>
at the time of the Winter Olympics in Norway. </i></A>

And now the feeling that what I am going to write<BR>
is being anticipated.
<P>
I envision a neural interface that when fed data about future events<BR>
would -- using an exact model of her brain -- model a writer's response.
<P>
And then, as if a writer worked on a terrible psychological battleground<BR>
for which a cowardly enemy held the knowledge of her battle plan... 
<P>    
No matter what the stated purpose of the research<BR>
its real intent -- to silence writers, to silence this writer --<BR>
was apparent. </i></A>

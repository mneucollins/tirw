<i>There are indications that the lives and careers of artists<BR>
have been under observation, for centuries.<BR>
The lives of artists curtailed by inquisitor murderers.<BR>
The careers of artists diverted.
<P>
Remember Ernest Hemingway
<P>
Depressed and suicidal, in 1961,<BR>
he went to the Mayo clinic under an assumed name.
<P>
Although FBI records now confirm that Hemingway was under surveillance,<BR>
he was having difficulty convincing his friends and family<BR>
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was watching his every move.
<P>
In a chilling incident<BR>
of collaborative intelligence agency and medical profession stalking of artists,<BR>
a psychiatrist at the clinic contacted the FBI<BR>
and then told Hemingway<BR>
that the FBI knew he had registered under an assumed name.<BR>
The Mayo Clinic gave Hemingway shock treatments;<BR>
he lost his memory and ability to write.
<P>
A few months later, Ernest Hemingway committed suicide.</i></A>

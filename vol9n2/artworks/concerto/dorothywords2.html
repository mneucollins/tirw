<A HREF="dorothy3.html" target="_top">
<i>I will paint Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy, Grace Kelly, and Audrey Hepburn<BR>
in the lobby of an elegant hotel,<BR> 
speaking to each other as though they are old friends<BR>
who met unexpectedly.
<P>
The lobby of the hotel framed by sandstone-colored columns and arches<BR> 
like those that Quattrocento painters created<BR>
in the magical landscapes<BR>
that surround their resonant Biblical narratives.
<P>
And in the background, the stars of early Hollywood who died too young:<BR>
Rudolph Valentino, Veronica Lake, Carole Landis, Alan Ladd, Jean Harlow.<BR>
There are many others. 
<P>
It was only last week that I watched Grace Kelly in <i>High Society</i>,<BR>
sitting by the swimming pool while a toy sailboat metamorphosed into a sloop<BR>
carrying two newlyweds out of Newport Harbor.</i></A>

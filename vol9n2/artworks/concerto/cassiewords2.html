<i>For who among us would support a nightmare scenario<BR> 
in which our heavenly environment,<BR>
and the weather that nurtures us,<BR> 
are usurped by defense scientists of opposing armies,<BR> 
that would turn our shared world<BR> 
into a battleground?
<P>
The skies in which at night we see the stars<BR> 
and in the morning the sun rises,<BR>
the rain that comes at the will of the heavens,<BR>
the gift of snow falling through the night,<BR> 
warm breezes on the beach<BR>
were not created as weapons of warfare.</i></A>

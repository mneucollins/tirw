<A HREF="cassie8.html" target="_top">
<i>I was at home watching the 1971 World Series with my Dad<BR>
when Roberto Clemente hit the home run<BR>
that started the Pittsburgh Pirates on their victory over the Baltimore Orioles.<BR>
Clemente, who was born in Puerto Rico, was voted the series MVP.<BR>
I remember the celebration in Pittsburgh after the game.
<P>
A little more than a year later, I had moved to California,<BR>
but I went home for holidays.<BR>
I was home with my family when Roberto Clemente died on New Year's Eve.<BR>
He was personally taking food and supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua.<BR>
when the plane he was on crashed near the coast of Puerto Rico.
<P>
I remember the pleasure of watching Clemente<BR> 
in the field and at the plate
<P>
and the candlelight vigil on the Isla Verde beach.</i></A>

<blockquote>
<A HREF="gwen5.html" target="_top"><i>My life now led on a psychological battleground<BR>
where every word I write is created<BR> 
in skirmish with some despicable ancient cult.
<P>
Malicious neuro-surveillance generated playback theater.<BR>
Intelligence agency slight of hand,<BR>
developed during World War II at Camp X.
<P>
Half asleep I recalled an electromagnetic research laboratory.<BR>
The lab had a NASA contract to investigate the D-layer of the atmosphere,<BR>
a place where communications were lost in spaceship reentry.<BR>
In the center of an enormous room was a blue vacuum chamber,<BR>
where the plasma that simulated the D-layer of silence<BR>
was housed.
<P>
(As if we were purposely put in the path of some ancient vendetta,<BR>
I have always felt that we -- my first husband, who was Catholic, and I<BR>
 -- were herded into break up<BR>
almost from the very beginning.)</i></A>

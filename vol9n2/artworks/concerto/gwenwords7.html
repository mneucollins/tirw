<A HREF="gwen8.html" target="_top">
<i>In a Shanghai prison during the Cultural Revolution<BR>
on the paper supplied by his jailors for "self criticism", <BR>
Chinese artist Mu Xin silently creates an extraordinary work of calligraphy.
<P> 
In a Berkeley apartment, an American artist tethered to an imposed profession<BR>
creates a work of art on index cards.
<P>
Later, when he was put under house arrest,<BR>
Mu Xin created a series of ethereal landscape memories.
<P>
Each painted on a small piece of paper,<BR>
each invoking the memory of the countryside that nurtured his spirit,<BR> 
and was now denied.</i>

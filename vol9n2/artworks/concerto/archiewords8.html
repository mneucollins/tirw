<i>Initiated in the secret research of World War II and the Cold War,<BR>
in laboratories across the country,<BR> 
an arsenal that could change the very nature of our existence<BR> 
is being developed.
<P>
When from published research, we can demonstrate their existence<BR>
and the clear potential for their abuse,<BR>
it is time to encourage informed media coverage;<BR>
to vote for and support representatives<BR>
who are tough enough to formulate policies<BR>
that will criminalize the covert use of invasive technologies<BR>
on ourselves, on animals, and on the environment.
<P>
It is time to stop the systems of interference,<BR>
to put in place an effective and continuing oversight<BR>
that looks at intelligence agencies, defense research, and industry<BR> 
in terms of their impact on our country<BR>
and on the world that we share with other nations.<i>

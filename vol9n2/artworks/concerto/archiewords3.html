<i>The technologies for a system to torture people unseen,<BR>
now exist.<BR>
To a certain extent, someone could use wireless brain interference technologies<BR>
to cause pain in our bodies;<BR> 
make us fall or bump into things; cause accidents;<BR>
ruin our work by interfering with the motion of our hands.
<P>
With these technologies, a cruel government could silently ensnare us<BR>
in a virtual gulag.
<P>
Athletes subjected by gamblers to covert interference with their bodies.<BR>
Artists hurt because of what they create.

Our lives at the mercy of heartless puppeteers.</i></A>

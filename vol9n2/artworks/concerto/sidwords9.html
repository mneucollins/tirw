<i>The losses to our culture are relentless.<BR>
I set them forth not to imply that tragedy is the fate of every artist,<BR>
but rather because I think that if they are documented,<BR> 
it will become clear that there are patterns,<BR>
that the losses are beyond coincidence.
<P>
About 25 years ago, I watched Bill Jones and Arnie Zane dance together. <BR> 
I was in New York City. Alone.  Looking at art.<BR>
And I went to see Blauvelt Mountain not knowing what to expect.
<P>
I have never forgotten that performance. <BR>
The relationship between the two men --<BR>
Arnie, Jewish from the Bronx,<BR>  
Bill, African American from upstate New York --<BR> 
the shared path of dance that they created together.
<P>
A few year later, Arnie Zane was dead. Lost to AIDS. </i></A>

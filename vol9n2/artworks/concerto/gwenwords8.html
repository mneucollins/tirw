<A HREF="gwen10.html" target="_top">
<i>Japanese American Chiura Obata created transcendent paintings<BR>
of the California hills,<BR>
the mountains, the waterfalls,<BR>
bridges over streams, rocks and water.
<P>
And he taught art at the University of California in Berkeley.
<P>
But along with more than 100,000 other Japanese Americans,<BR>
he was imprisoned in 1942 by the US Government.
<P> 
Then at Tanforan and Topaz, he taught art to his fellow prisoners, and he drew<BR> 
the camps in which he was confined.<BR>
I remember a watercolor of a woman and her children. Behind barbed wire,<BR>
they are reading posted regulations.<BR>
Unreachable in the far distance<BR>
are the mountains and hills that he painted when he was free.
<P>
After the War, Chiura Obata was reinstated as a professor of art at Cal.<BR>
I imagine him hiking with the Sierra Club,<BR>
once again sketching and painting<BR>
the mountains of California.</i></A>

<A HREF="cassie7.html" target="_top">
<i>In these times of trouble, the things that bring us together<BR>
are the shared stories of courage and friendship.<BR>
The story of Chicago Bears running backs Gayle Sayers and Brian Piccolo,<BR> 
the first African American and white teammates<BR>
to room together in the National Football League.
<P>
Brian Piccolo rushing 100-yards to beat the New Orleans Saints.<BR> 
Gayle Sayers' heroism in coming back from a shattering knee injury.<BR>
His record as the NFL all-time leader in kickoff returns<BR>
despite continued knee problems.<BR>
Brian Piccolo's brave battle with cancer.
<P>
The way the two men helped each other. Friendship and sports excellence<BR>
in a story where one of the heroes battled injuries throughout his career,<BR>
and the other was dead of cancer at age twenty-six.</i></A>

<i>I dreamed of rooms of surveillance<BR>
where subjected to the yoke of artificial intelligence<BR>
all our words and deeds are collected by machines. 
<P>
I speak with sorrow.<BR>
My sorrow. The sorrow of many others<BR>
The spiritual healing that we seek so difficult<BR> 
knowing that our every thought and word and deed is observed.<BR>
<P>
If there is comfort left in my invaded soul,<BR>
I share it with all who have walked the paths that I have walked.</i></A>

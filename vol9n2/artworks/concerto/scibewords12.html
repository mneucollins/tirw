<i>Remembering
<P>
National Downhill champion Dick Buek,<BR> 
who died when his plane crashed at Donner Summit<BR>
near his home in the mountains of California.
<P>
Twenty-one year old Sun Valley ski racer Jimmy Griffith,<BR>
who should have been in the 1952 Olympics.<BR>
He died when he hit a tree at Alta.
<P>
Slalom Champion Jill Kinmont, from Bishop, California.<BR>
Expected to be on the US Olympic ski team,<BR>
she was paralyzed after plunging off a hill at Alta.
<P>
Her life nevertheless an inspiration.
<P>
Now looking at our lives with sorrow,<BR>
I remember how Jill's best friend, the skier Audra Jo Nicholson<BR> 
had her career ended by polio.</i>

<blockquote>
<i>I dreamed that all around the world --<BR>
people who work for our communities,<BR>
churches, people who speak for peace,<BR>
people who speak for human rights, for animals, for the environment,<BR>
writers, musicians, dancers, artists, film and theater artists, the media,<BR>
scientists, researchers, doctors, psychiatrists, inventors,<BR>
veterans, unions, athletes, statesmen and women, intelligence agents,<BR>
and many others -- came together to expose the systems of persecution.
<P>
I heard their words.<BR>
And in the morning when I awoke<BR>
all around the world, in every nation,<BR>
the bells in the towns and the cities were ringing for freedom and peace.</i>

<blockquote>
<A HREF="sid4.html" target="_top">
<i>
A woman sits on a chair in a spare setting.<BR> 
Beside a small table, she is mixing batter in a bowl.<BR>
The drawing that conveys this scene is "At Home - Beginning",<BR>
an illustration created in 1938<BR>
by African American printmaker Robert Blackburn,<BR>  
<P>
The artist was a young man when he created it.<BR>
But the drawing is remarkable for its expression of core human values.<BR>
In an abstract vocabulary.<BR> 
The shape of the woman's arms. The bowl.<BR>
The way her checked apron focuses the composition.<BR>
A perfectly rendered action.<BR> 
The deft conveyance of the creation of nourishment<BR>
in a place of poverty.<i></A>

<i>My sorrow is for the halted sound of Mozart's musical laughter,<BR>
for the painters who were killed in accidents.<BR> 
I will never see the unfinished canvases in their studios.
<P>
My tears are for the poets who died in poverty,<BR>
for Frida Kahlo, her entire life spent in pain.
<P>
My sorrow is for the lost live sounds<BR>
 of Glenn Miller's band and Jerry Garcia's guitar,<BR> 
the lost voices of Bessie Smith, Janis Joplin, and Roy Orbison,<BR> 
for Carole Lombard's lost life, the films she never made,<BR>
for the entire 1961 US Skating Team<BR>
killed in a plane crash, their burnt skates in the rubble.<BR>
<P>
My tears are for the stilled feet of the dancers who died of AIDS.</i></A>

<i>In the dream I was walking with Norbert Wiener in Cambridge.<BR>
Or was it Belmont?<BR>  
We were trying to find his house because he couldn't remember where it was. 
<P>
As we walked around in circles, he told me of his decision<BR> 
not to work on weapons-related research.<BR>
"It was 1946", he said.
<P>
I was worried about why he was having trouble remembering.<BR>
I wanted to ask him if he knew that the FBI was watching him.<BR>
But it was only a dream.<BR> 
And the man who created the word "cybernetics" was gone.</i></A>

<i>
I dreamed of rooms of surveillance
where subjected to the yoke of artificial intelligence
all our words and deeds are collected by machines.
<P>
where the records of everyone in the country
were stored on silent supercomputers.
The doors were guarded by uniformed sentries;
a group of people were gathered around a monitor.
<P>
On the screen, a complex visual came slowly into focus.
I saw my name and beside it,
details of meetings with past boyfriends,
known, I thought, only to me.</i>

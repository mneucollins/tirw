<A HREF="scibe3.html" target="_top">
<i>In the dream, I am in the stands watching Helen Wills.<BR>
The power of her forehand. The strength of her backhand.<BR>
She is wearing white on the beautiful grass courts.
<P>
In the dream, I see a laboratory<BR> 
where without her knowledge<BR>
the brain waves that control every move she makes<BR> 
are recorded on an endless row of computers.
<P>
Her ability to anticipate the moves of her opponents.<BR>
Stolen by researchers and machines. 
<P>
But she, winner of Wimbledon, stands tall,<BR>
wearing white on the green grass courts.
<P>
Remembered forever for her grace and skill.</i></A>

<A HREF="voices3.html" target="_top"><i>The spirit of John Muir walks with us<BR>
in the meadows, forests, valleys and mountains<BR> 
but not in the Hetch Hetchy Valley of the Tuolumne River.
<P>
The grassroots campaign to halt the ruin of Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley,<BR>
failed.<BR>
The River was damned; the Valley was flooded.<BR>
A year later, John Muir died suddenly of Pneumonia.
<P>
He lived the life that he wrote, walking the woods.<BR>
drawing, writing every detail of the forest.
<P>
He left us the gift of eternal landscape<BR> 
forever free and open.</i></A>

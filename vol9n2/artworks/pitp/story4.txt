After listening to a half hour of explanation about the far-reaching implications of Rook and Co.'s case to secure patents for plot devices and novelties and how that paved the way for the passage of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act Revision Umpteen-Whatever, Stan's eyes had nearly glazed over. It wasn't until Davis mentioned a familiar name that Stan rejoined the stream of words he had long ceased to care about.

"We can start with this guy, Morton. He is the most likely candidate, and paved the way for these other infringements on our IP."

"IP?"

"Intellectual Property. Jesus, man, are you listening to me at all?"

"Yeah. But what's it about Joe again?"

Davis produced a copy of RADDSTURR-Nomics from his folio. "Did you ever read this?"

Stan took the book and flipped through it, nodding. On the inside back cover is a photo of the author, Joseph P. Morton, PhD., looking too serious from behind square glasses.

Davis reached again into his folio. "But did you ever read this?"

He placed a thick stack of binder-clipped pages on the table. The title was clear: "Radder You, Radder Me: RADDSTURR-dot-com and the Birth of P2P Viral Marketing." A right side alignment declared the title smart and a bold, yet lean, sans-serif font raged to the modernity of the concepts within. Stan read through the abstract on the front page, shaking his head.

"This outlines every move you ever made with the RADDSTURR marketing campaign, from the dorm thing to the other stuff."

"It does?"

"Not only that, but this has become standard reading in a good number of college classrooms now. RADDSTURR has set an innovative form of academic precedent. That's another patentable innovation." Davis was breathless."This guy has built a whole career on this stuff. And so have countless screwball marketing students. He's toast."

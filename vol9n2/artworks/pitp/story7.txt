A few days after the event, Morton had not returned to school. The department had begun to discuss having someone permanently take over his courses. There was great anxiety in the school about Morton's departure. Some faculty had overheard and said the agents mentioned a copyright violation of some kind, possibly plagiarism. But that made no sense. Most of the faculty agreed that it must have been his research. Some had heard Morton discuss his findings, and considered his domain the dark side of technology, far away from the secure databases and peer-reviewed websites they had come to love.

It occurred to a couple of the more charitable souls in the department that in fact all the things that Morton talked about, which they really never understood or cared about anyway, may have had some use, and he might right now be helping the government avoid an international conflict or avert a terrorist attack.

Many of the faculty remained silent on the issue. What had happened was not their fault, nor their problem. They quietly unsubscribed from their left-wing mailing lists and kept to themselves.

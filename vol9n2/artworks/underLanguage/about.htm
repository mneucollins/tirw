About the Work
</h2>

<p>
"Under Language" is the latest in my series of textual <em>instruments</em>, a term
I borrowed from John Cayley many years ago to describe things that might look
like literature, but also like structures for play, though not necessarily what
we would call <em>games</em>.
</p><p>
In fact, this one lies pretty close to game space, having rules, a scoring system (albeit invisible),
and even a simple <em>agon</em> in which you compete against the perversity
of the puzzle-maker, and constraints of the clock.
</p><p>
The phrase "under-language" was invented by the comics artist, Alan Moore, in an interview
he gave in the early 1980s.  He used it to describe the essence of comics art, which is neither
verbal nor visual, but something that underlies and infuses both modes.
The term gets at the essence behind Moore's great genius for irony and verbal-visual puns.
It also provides a convenient reminder that everything, these days, tends to mean more
than it seems.
</p><p>
Steeped in double senses, and devoted to play, the "Under Language" offered here 
nonetheless attempts to express something serious about words:
namely, that in the era that succeeds the old Age of Print, we need to notice how 
<em>writing</em> intersects <em>code</em>.
</p><p>
In more subtle moods, one might think of this convergence in terms of negotiation, or seduction: 
as courtship, dance, or embrace.
</p><p>
In no mood for subtlety, I enact it here as collision, or slapstick.  Poetry, in motion, meets code,
coming the other way at speed.  You find yourself under language, so look out below.

<strong>Proprieties</strong>
</p><p>
All text and graphics (spoken and written) are the work of the author, as is the
code.  The work was programmed in ActionScript 2.0, using Macromedia Flash 8.
Synthetic voices used in audible passages are ScanSoft's Samantha and (briefly) Daniel.
Ambient sound collages were assembled primarily from samples at the
<a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/">Freesound</a> archive.
Graphics were produced with Poser 7, using figures from Digital Art Zone
and various assets from Renderosity.  All such assets are used non-commercially
in compliance with relevant licenses.

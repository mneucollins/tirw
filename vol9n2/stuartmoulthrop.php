Stuart Moulthrop is an award-winning writer and digital artist based in Baltimore, Maryland.  He is the author of <i>_Victory Garden_</i>, a novel-length hypertext fiction included by Robert Coover in the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of electronic literature.  His later works, all with considerably higher brass content, include &ldquo;Hegirascope&rdquo; (1995), &ldquo;Reagan Library&rdquo; (1999), &ldquo;Pax&rdquo; (2003), &ldquo;Under Language&rdquo; (2007), and &ldquo;Deep Surface&rdquo; (2007).  The last two won prizes in the 2007 Ciutat de Vinaros international competition.  &ldquo;Reagan Library&rdquo; has been included in the first Electronic Literature Collection, and was recently translated into Chinese by the Taiwanese scholar Shuen-shing Lee.

 In addition to creative work, Moulthrop is known for essays on digital art and culture, some of which have been multiply republished and translated.  &ldquo;You Say You Want a Revolution?&rdquo;, his 1991 reflection on the brand-new media, once had the last word in the <i>Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism</i>.  His editorial projects include service with the pioneering on-line journal <i>Postmodern Culture</i>, whose first issue of born-digital content he assembled, including important works by John Cayley and Michael Joyce.

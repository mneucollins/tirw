      <p> Artists are like the canary in the coal mine, but instead of being
        harbingers of doom, they are, instead, often exquisitely attuned to the
        new. They have a need to eclipse previous boundaries. Of course, nothing
        can be completely new or else it would be unintelligible, a claim some
        make for <em>Finnegan's Wake, </em> various forms of poetry, or extreme
        visual art. One's ability to understand that which is on the edge in
        the arts depends, as does understanding of science, on previous training.
        For instance, the Modernism and Postmodernism that Pinker criticizes
        could be seen as utterly etiolated, and therefore unavailable to the
        uninitiated. Most people are not trained in appreciation of art and literature;
        there must be exposure, excitement, and, particularly in the appreciation
        of literature, adequate reading skills. This does not negate the fact
        that many people deeply enjoy literature, and, in particular, Modernist
        and Postmodernist work. If the vast majority of humanity prefers landscapes
        unlayered with meaning, or simple stories of vengeance that include a
        lot of explosions, or love stories with the usual complications, this
        does not mean that those who prefer more complexity are poseurs, as Pinker
        seems to insinuate. It only means that there are not many of them, just
        as there are relatively few astrophysicists, cutting edge biologists,
        and accomplished mathematicians. Those who are at the top of their field
        and inclined (or able) to communicate what they know in language understandable
        to laypeople are very few indeed. So it is, perhaps, with the biological
        predilection for the study of extreme literature. The pleasures are there
        to be experienced, but it is difficult to communicate the reasons for
      this pleasure to the uninitiated. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>That which we know, or believe, about reality and about nature deeply
        informs society and, in its turn, literature and art. In the late nineteenth
        century, issues of class began to dissolve before the bare fact that
        evolution is the product of pure chance, and has no peak, no pinnacle.
        This theory is so counterintuitive that it is still not widely understood,
        and is rejected outright by more people than accept it. But Darwin's
        radical work, which was a completely new way of looking at nature, seemed
        to remove theological and God from "Creation," and had a huge influence
        on how people regarded themselves in relation to the rest of the natural
        world. </p>
      <p>Because of this change, a new energy began to pervade literature, and
        all of the arts--an energy that reflected the new, scientific spirit
        of the time. The literature of the Victorian age, which concentrated
        on the vagaries of class and of class distinctions--the idea that that
        the wealthy are rich because they have a divine dispensation that originated
        with God and then made its way &quot;downward&quot; through queen to
        burgher to peasant--receded, and literatures in which individuals, and
        their thought processes, came to the forefront. The Romantics, with their
        mystical vision of a meaning-infused landscape, were also eclipsed. Western
        literature's focus was no longer about perfecting the self and the soul
        in order to become more Christlike. Just as Darwin demolished the mirror
        of God in which Western civilization had seen  itself for millennia,
        literature stopped reproducing a social order that descended from God
        and began, instead, to look inward at this strange, new, disturbing phenomenon--the
        human being, no longer outside of the natural world, but produced by
        it. This was truly a new and astonishing idea, and was still astonishing
        when Francis Crick published <em>The Astonishing Hypothesis: &nbsp; The
        Scientific Search for the Soul, </em><a href="#10">[10]</a>  which
        encompasses this idea and the magnitude of social, emotional, and mental
        upheaval it continues to engender. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Calvino, in <em>The Uses of Literature, </em>says, "The power of modern
        literature lies in its willingness to give a voice to what has remained
        unexpressed in the social or individual unconscious: &nbsp; this is the
        gauntlet it throws down time and again." <a href="#11">[11]</a> Instead
        of sailing from continent to continent and encountering new external
        wonders, authors began to examine what was close at hand, previously
        unexplored by science, and utterly mysterious: &nbsp; consciousness.
        Henry James brought psychology, another new field, into literature. James'
        lush sentences expand to include multitudes of introspective thoughts
        in which the protagonists attempt to understand their motivations, their
        actions, the power of their memories, and how such attributes affect
        the actions of others. </p>
      <p>In Woolf's work, consciousness is a kind of cloud which she as the author
        accesses at will, almost as if the thoughts of everyone are blending,
        in some unseen, invisible place, in the aether, in the newly-discovered
        place where relativity is not a thought-game, but reality itself. Stein
        attempts an even deeper dive in an attempt to fix on the place where
        thought is rendered into language, that mysterious, almost divine crux
        where thought and matter seem to be one, where Keat's Grecian Urn is
        pure thought, platonic perfection, and still an everyday object in the
        world. </p>
      <p>For Joyce, all of existence is language--foreign, perhaps, but charged
        with deep meaning, the meaning of rock, seaweed, color. "Ineluctable
        modality of the visible: &nbsp; at least that if no more, thought through
        my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack,
        the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: &nbsp; coloured
        signs." <a href="#12">[12]</a> </p>
      <p>Far from being ultra-refined or removed from real life, as Pinker would
        have it, the Moderns were the first to attempt not just to tell stories
        and relate those stories to  God, the gods, morals, or societal constructs,
        but to get to the center of the mystery of consciousness. They grabbed
        hold of the line wavering downward, inward, through the pellucid, curiously
        liquid attribute we call awareness and pulled themselves into the depths.
        Literature no longer took the reader on a concrete and satisfying timebound
        trip of morals or manners or the exterior facts of the protagonist's
        life. Instead, the moderns sought to go deeper into the well of consciousness,
        to deconstruct it as scientists were deconstructing the mysteries of
        time and space. The physical world was just a jumping-off place, engendering
        thoughts that rippled and eddied through the medium of the mind like
        waves from a stone cast into a pool. Modern literature is an attempt
        to fathom, to recreate, the state of an individual's awareness, many
        steps back from the artifices of fortune and society, so that the bare
        temporal act of consciousness itself is rendered at the first waypoint
        from which it bubbles forth: our thoughts, just barely caught in the
        net of verbalization. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>This seems like no mean task--indeed, the work of the Moderns seems
        like the first non-religious attempt at a true study of consciousness.
        All study begins with observation, and this is what the Moderns did. &nbsp; </p>
      A new interiority, combined with the division of matter and its necessary
      companion, time, into finer and finer unseen particles and energies, is
      paralleled by Joyce's and Woolf's division of consciousness into ever more
      fine units of time. In the same stroke, with Einstein's theory of relativity,
      time lost adherence to any solid touchstone, and instead expanded and contracted
      according to laws that only those deeply initiated in mathematics and physics
      could begin to understand, but to which Proust's long life-work, In <em> Search
      of Lost Time, </em>owes much.

      <p>Catherine Gudis's <em>Buyways: Billboards, Automobiles, and the American
          Landscape </em> follows James Fraser's 1991 <em>The American Billboard:
          100 Years </em> as one of the few histories devoted to the once omnipresent
          and surprisingly rich medium of the commercial billboard. &nbsp; Exhaustively
          researched, <em>Buyways </em> occurs at the intersection of such other
          popular scholarly works as Stephen Kern's <em>The Culture of Time and
          Space 1880-1918 </em>, Jackson Lears's <em>Fables of Abundance: A Cultural
          History of Advertising in America </em>, Roland Marchand's <em>Advertising
          the American Dream: Making Way for Modernity, 1920-1940 </em>, and
          Cecelia Tichi's <em>Shifting Gears: Technology, Literature, Culture
          in Modernist America </em>--all of which aim to further access what
          Raymond Williams would call the &quot;structure of feeling&quot; of
          a turn-of-the-century America consumed by issues of speed, mass production,
          efficiency, leisure, and expanding technology. &nbsp; Through the unexpectedly
          significant and dramatic portal of outdoor advertising--though perhaps &quot;tollbooth&quot; is
          a more appropriate image in this context--Gudis explores the larger
          culture of American mobility, the decentralization of the market, and
          emerging concerns over the stewardship of nature and the highway landscape. </p>
      <p>&quot; <em>Buyways </em>,&quot; Gudis writes, &quot;is organized around
        the themes of production, distribution, and consumption&quot; and begins
        with a reminder that the construction and use of billboards emerged from
        the competitive and sometimes violent practice of nineteenth century
        billposting that converted urban and rural landscape alike into one that
        was &quot;slathered in paper and paste.&quot; &nbsp; The advent of the
        automobile, however, changed the dynamic of that slather as it forced
        advertisers to deal with newly &quot;mobile audiences&quot; while converting
        American highways into &quot;corridors of consumption&quot;--a market
        shift that would eventually have substantial impact on urban design,
        among other things. &nbsp; Billboard execs discovered that their traditional
        text-heavy messages couldn't contend with the potholes, shifting gears,
        and scenic landscapes that vied for the speedy reader's attention, and
        so, Gudis argues, billboard advertising gradually began to feature &quot;more
        simplified, abstract, and streamlined means of representing and selling
        the lessons of mobility.&quot; &nbsp; Hence the birth of logos and single
        images, &quot;messages yielding unblinking recognition,&quot; and even
        forays into modern art forms and designs, to develop a medium that wouldn't
        just &quot;survive the inattentive gaze of viewers but rather <em>thrive </em> on
        the inattention of viewers.&quot; &nbsp; </p>
      <p>If Part One of <em>Buyways </em> can be read as the formal development
        of the billboard as genre, then Part Two looks past the board to the
        organization of the outdoor advertising industry--its professional affiliations,
        implementation of industry standards, attempts at self-regulation, etc.--and,
        even more importantly, to how the industry &quot;developed an architecture
        of mobility expressly suited to the decentralizing commercial arena&quot; in
        the U.S. &nbsp; These billboards construed travelers as twentieth-century
        flaneurs taking in the world from &quot;the private space of their cars&quot; and
        attempted to direct them how, when, and where to consume while helping
        to culturally &quot;zone&quot; the strip and its parking lots, grocery
        stores, gas stations, etc. &nbsp; In &quot;fostering&quot; what Gudis
        says is &quot;our present sense of placelessness and the meandering of
        the market beyond geographic boundaries,&quot; these billboards took
        on increasingly elaborate tasks, with some even including theatrical
        stages and &quot;showroom&quot; windows on and behind which real people
        demonstrated the products being advertised around them. &nbsp; Not only
        did billboards sell individual products, Gudis argues, but by including
        electricity, clocks, on-site car dealerships and parking lots, they helped
        to construct and sell an entire culture of mobility and technology as
        well. </p>
      <p>As billboard culture threatened to become as chaotic and competitive
        as the bill posting industry out of which it grew--editorial cartoons
        of the time show drivers walled-out from the landscape by billboards
        placed end-to-end along highways--public sentiment began to turn sour. &nbsp; Part
        Three of <em>Buyways </em> chronicles the &quot;scenic sisters&quot; and
        other largely women-led attempts to lobby for reforms aimed at restricting &quot;billboard
        barons&quot; and the &quot;visual pollution&quot; (elsewhere called &quot;landscape
        leprosy&quot; and &quot;billboard rash&quot;) obstructing the driver's
        experience of nature and the landscape. &nbsp; In demonstrating how these
        women attempted to extend aesthetic control over the domestic realm into
        a cluttered and unsightly public sphere, Gudis makes some of her more
        original and insightful contributions, especially in &quot;The Pastoral
        View&quot; which examines how reformers &quot;cast the highway, like
        the department store and picture palace, as another site of mass consumption,
        and the panorama of nature was the commodity for sale.&quot; &nbsp; Far
        from preserving the landscape, these efforts sought &quot;to produce
        a good picture according to very specific cultural and aesthetic principles.&quot; &nbsp; </p>

      <p>Language, Consciousness, and Literature </p>
      <p>Language and its more permanent sister, literature, attest to the existence
        of that which we call consciousness in ourselves and in others. Literature
        springs from that ability which most defines us as humans: &nbsp; language.
        Language could be said to be the truest indication and reflection of
        consciousness, since consciousness is shot through with and almost indivisible
        from language. Our innermost thoughts reverberate with unsaid words,
        fleeting fragments of supposition, memories, plans. Literature is consciousness
        rendered portable and transferable, a potent key to the nature of consciousness,
        its fellow traveler since the dawn of recorded thought. The origins of
        language, the use of symbols, and the flourishing of literature are intertwined
        in a single braid. </p>
      <p>We are a communicative species. The very basis of our form of consciousness,
        our awareness of our own existence in time, is posited on feedback. For
        virtually all of us, much feedback is in the form of language, and we
        have developed ways to use even touch to decipher it. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>We are also storytellers. Our feedback is not limited to information
        about our immediate environment, like the biological feedback of microbes,
        bees, or even other mammals. Instead, our stories can be as precise and
        limited as records of crops harvested and taxed, or as emotionally complicated
        as a Shakespeare play. We all shape reality through narrative. The schoolchild
        tells her father what happened in kindergarten, fashioning a story, re-membering
        it, re-animating it, casting what may have been pure motion and pure
        thought into words, and at the same time finding out that her report
        becomes, in some measure, what actually happened--because what really
        happened is gone. Many stories are necessary to survival, as we are communal
        animals: it is important that we coordinate our efforts, and try to avoid
        coming to blows and sapping the resources of the community with physical
        recovery or with permanent loss of vital skills. Human history, and present-day
        politics, is a grievous record of what happens when speech fails, or
        when our stories are not rendered in a persuasive fashion. By externalizing
        our stories and recording them, we have been able to accumulate vast
        stores of information crucial to our survival as a species, and have
        virtually taken over the earth and its resources for our own use. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Through sharing a system of meaning-packed symbols, humans have created
        cultures, civilizations, and sciences far too complex for any single
        one of us to remember or use in its entirety. </p>
      <p>Once we acquired a certain facility with language, and particularly
        in creating a record of language, our rootedness and isolation in time
        was banished, or at least tremendously modified. Chunks of time--subjective
        time, at least, which Einstein showed is really the only kind of time--can
        be moved from mind to mind. We transform what is fleeting--verbalized
        thought--into a concrete object to which we can return again and again
        without loss or degradation of the original information, thereby making
        it possible to record edifices of complex reasoning. Moreover, we are
        able to combine these elements in an infinitely variable manner. It is
        this ability to signify, to modify the signals, to delight in their plasticity
        and rhythmic beauty, and to record them that sets us apart from the rest
        of the living world. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Literature, though, is more self-aware than mere storytelling. It is
        a deliberate placing of word against word until there is an edifice of
        thought, an exercise almost impossible unless one has not only a symbolic
        system, but also the means to re-create and preserve symbols. Literature--from
        the Latin for &quot;letter&quot;--is external, communal consciousness,
        loosed from dependence on one frail biological entity and from that person's
        limited lifespan. It is representative of time lived--real or fictional--and
        has the power to free both the writer and the reader, if not from time
        itself, then from a limited sense of time. Memory--accessed by an object,
        a vision, a flavor--is explored, recast as empowering myth, a warning
        fable, a rich expansion of our own time to include a fictional other's
        sense of life; another's consciousness. We can invent as many new conjunctions
        of event and emotion as there are moments of awareness. This exploration
        of temporality--and our conquering of it, at least in some measure--is
        one of the most important aspects of literature. Utterly dependent upon
        time, we are biological orchestrations that fall apart when any one of
        billions of exquisitely timed biochemical interactions is disrupted.
        Our seeming freedom from this dependency when we use language to go forward,
        backwards, and sideways in the strange medium of time, space, and biology
        from which we spring, is the heart of literature's power. Literature
        is the conscious manipulation of metanarratives, and is arguably the
        art form closest to consciousness itself, as authors concern themselves
        with trying to represent the thoughts of their characters. </p>
      <p>The sense of self is a sense of movement, a constant calculus, as Buckminster
        Fuller proclaimed when he stated, &quot;I am a verb.&quot; Even when
        we do not move, as in sleep, we dream motion. Literature is like a dream
        in that the motion therein is also purely cerebral, and invites us into,
        and infuses us with, the temporal dreams of others. Some dreams we find
        so real, so compelling, so truthful, that we revere the dream and the
        dreamer, the book and the author, the tribal tale and the bard. In dreams,
        we live outside of time; the stuff of our lives is compressed, rearranged,
        by a facility which we do not seem to control. Literature gives us control
        of the image-and-thought-stream of life and our representations of life,
        our stories. </p>

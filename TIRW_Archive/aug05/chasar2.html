      <p>With 50 pages of notes, <em>Buyways </em> is a welcome--seemingly comprehensive--synthesis
        of multiple, disparate, and oftentimes hard to find sources, and it should
        serve as an indispensable source book for those working with related
        subjects in the future. &nbsp; At the same time, Gudis's argument could
        benefit from a more sophisticated theoretical framework. &nbsp; This
        is a historical project, to be sure, but one senses that Gudis too often
        tries to fit the history of billboarding and its billboards under one
        rubric, treating it as a more or less single commercial project rather
        than a diverse array of communication or speech acts. &nbsp; Gudis is
        at her most compelling when she allows time to work through critical
        evaluation, and more &quot;close readings&quot; of individual billboards
        would have elicited more in the way of cultural significance and highlighted
        the multiplicity of strategies at work within the medium. &nbsp; Surely,
        billboards painted to look like the landscape surrounding them ( <em>Ce
        n'est pas un billboard </em>) and the complicated logistics of &quot;showroom&quot; billboards
        involving living people could benefit from a variety of approaches. </p>
      <p>A special and larger case in point concerns how Gudis configures billboard
        literacy and how to understand the process of driving through, and reading,
        a textual and/or commercial landscape. &nbsp; Gudis begins <em>Buyways </em> by
        noting the textual collage and palimpsests created by almost manic bill
        posting on walls and trees, but by Chapter 4 (&quot;The Aesthetics of
        Speed and the Powers of 'Picturization'&quot;) she argues that billboards
        sought the more efficient image rather than &quot;clever verbal devices&quot; to &quot;consolidate
        the message&quot; and thus attempted, as much as possible, to eliminate
        words. &nbsp; &quot;Pictures, not text,&quot; she writes, &quot;were
        best remembered.&quot; &nbsp; This opens up an interesting discussion
        of the relationship between billboards and modern art, but the focus
        on image allows Gudis to short the textual landscape in her writing--even
        though that landscape was, and would continue to be imagined by the larger
        culture as, one largely made up of words and oftentimes very memorable
        words at that. &nbsp; From the &quot;Book Boards,&quot; which were &quot;'free-form'
        billboards in the shape of an open book&quot; erected in the 1920s, to
        Paramount Studio's 1932 boards which had four &quot;pages&quot; that
        were actually turned by attendants, advertisers never seemed too far
        away from the bibliographic in their ideas. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>This sense is confirmed elsewhere, as when, for example, Gudis quotes
        an advertiser who explains, &quot;Every panel is like an open book held
        up before the reader's eye, and the book is always open to your page.
        . .It has no cover on it.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; At other times, the medium
        is described as one which could &quot;talk the vernacular. . .the language
        of the common people&quot; and was thus valuable for teaching people &quot;a
        knowledge of letters.&quot; &nbsp; One also thinks of the successful
        Burma-Shave billboard campaign that, for nearly forty years, featured
        poems and no images, as well as another similarly poetic pitch that I
        happened upon in the General Outdoor Advertising Company's archives at
        the Indiana Historical Society. &nbsp; (See the graphic accompanying
        this review.) &nbsp; Punctuated by line drawings that attempted to illustrate
        the poem in between its words, this hybrid of text and image reads: &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Look both ways when crossing streets-- </p>
      <p>Walk S-l-o-w-l-y use your head! </p>
      <p>No matter if you're in a rush </p>
      <p>For jam and taystee bread! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S. &nbsp; It'll
        wait--it stays fresh! </p>
      <p>The poem's subject matter of slowness, caution, and waiting, along with
        its attempts to slow the reading experience by interspersing images and
        breaking the word &quot;slowly&quot; into its component parts, seems
        worth a second look for the ways in which it's not so clearly &quot;unblinking&quot; after
        all. &nbsp; Such closer considerations would not only help us to better
        understand this one textual landscape, but to more clearly come to grips
        with how the new media and especially the Web--the &quot;virtual highway&quot; that
        Gudis describes as &quot;the ultimate in billboard aesthetics&quot;--affect
        our reading and sense of literacy as well. </p>
      <p>In &quot;Reading as Poaching&quot; from <em>The Practice of Everyday
          Life </em>, Michel de Certeau writes that &quot;readers are travelers;
          they move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads poaching
          their way across field they did not write. . .Indeed, reading has no
          place.&quot; &nbsp; This note of &quot;placelessness&quot; is the same
          note that Gudis sounds throughout her book. &nbsp; De Certeau's reader
          and the decentralized American market don't readily go hand in hand,
          however, and would seem to offer a challenging and fruitful opportunity
          for further study. &nbsp; Despite this bump in the road, though, <em>Buyways </em> is
          a smooth ride and a very welcome spotlight on one of our more neglected
          media. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Mike Chasar has written about Burma-Shave's billboard poetry as well
        as the effect of billboards on the work of William Carlos Williams. &nbsp; His
        recent reviews and essays appear in TIRWeb 6.3, Rain Taxi, and Word for/
        Word. </p>

      <p>The direction of science and the direction of science fiction are at
        a shared, unique juncture--which has not always been true. It is a juncture
        which mainstream literature, for the most part, ignores. For instance,
        science fiction and biological reality converged in a particularly terrifying
        way during the anthrax scare, which awakened us to our own vulnerabilities--vulnerabilities
        which we cannot avoid, because they lie at the root of our biological
        being. But these same vulnerabilities have the potential to expand our
        lives in ways that we can now only imagine. We are entering the century
        in which we will explore not just matter, as we did in the twentieth
      century, but life itself. </p>
      <p>Despite its reputation, science fiction is no more predictive of the
        future than reading tealeaves. Instead, it is a lottery of possibilities,
        a crystal garden that begins with reality and then goes on, like all
        literatures, to build on the submerged texts upon which it stands. Science
        fiction in America started in the pulps, and its target audience, it
        is often said, was twelve-year-old boys. It has gone through many stages
        of growth since then, and perhaps is on the verge of another one.   </p>
      <p>Instead of being predictive or prescriptive, science fiction's greatest
        strength is that it is a revelatory literature, a way of thinking which
        takes into account the real world, and its real possibilities. It focuses
        on technological developments--which are the offspring of science--that
        have given us the wonders of the present day, negative and positive,
        that really do make a difference in our lives. It is an intellectually
        adventurous and, at it's best, edgy literature which foregrounds the
        astonishing, powerful actions of the human mind and the human imagination. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Science itself is neutral. It is just information. It has no moral content.
        In a manner analogous to the way we slant and manipulate events in the
        real world for fictional use, we use the information we discover to develop
        technologies. Our whole way of life is based on those relatively few
        people who were interested enough in nature to expand the knowledge that
        feeds technology. We humans are the only creatures who can actually and
        use what we know in order to radically change our environment - and ourselves.
        That is where sociological concerns arise. </p>
      <p>While we are still exploring the issues of time and space, we are now
        able to also explore life itself; perhaps even consciousness. Until now,
        we have been the same old humans with a lot of new toys. Our physical
        bodies have remained relatively unaltered while we converse with people
        on the other side of the world, or hurtle through the atmosphere at hundreds
        of miles an hour. We have had much success in dealing with infectious
        diseases. Lifesaving procedures such as bypass surgery are almost commonplace. </p>
      <p>We still remain the biggest mystery in the world. We are comprised of
        millions of programs, systems of evolutionary successes intimately linked
        to one another in a network which we are just beginning to understand. </p>
      <p>And understanding will bring manipulation, and manipulation will bring
        improvement. Or at least, change. That is, whose idea of improvement
        will we use? Richard B. Hoover, of NASA's Marshall space flight center
        said, &quot;A lot of paradigms about what life can and cannot do are
        coming apart now.&quot; <a href="#20">[20]</a> &nbsp; What
        might the new paradigms be? Science fiction explores them. </p>
      <p>Our emotional malleability at a young age allows us to mimic the cultural
        milieu into  which we are born perfectly. We absorb language, which is
        a social program in and of itself, effortlessly. Newborn infants react
        to tone of voice and eye contact. We are programmed to be a part of the
        community. We are exquisitely imprintable. We absorb our own culture
        much as we absorb food, and make it a part of our physical substance,
        our neural wiring, our filtering process. This human malleability is
        the source of much joy, and a lot of sorrow as well. There has been discourse
        for thousands of years about what the nature of a perfect human society
        might be. One society's criminal is another society's hero. </p>
      <p>But the marvel of it all is that all of this, every last raveling, is
        biological. </p>
      <p>We are entering a period of time when we will be able to cure cancers,
        heart disease, diabetes, and inherited disorders. The present debate
        over stem cell research is just the tip of the iceberg. We will soon
        have the opportunity to consider, as a society, just who we want ourselves
        to be. Presently, altering one's appearance through plastic surgery or
        even hair colorings or piercing falls into the category of vain frivolity.
        But when such alterations are deeper, more finely controlled, and more
        easily accomplished, how will we feel then? Let's say that it is possible
        to choose one's mood, one's very personality, with more precision. Who
        is doing the choosing? What is identity? Theological and philosophical
        questions have become scientifically accessible. </p>
      <p>What is information going to mean to us in the future--or for that matter,
        what does it mean to us in the present? Hypertexts, both literary and
        informational, give us the ability to browse information in a nonlinear
        way; a way, perhaps, akin to the way a toddler takes in information and
        begins to make links--except that we do this with a (more-or-less) mature
        brain. Thus, the intellectual and emotional experience of making new
        connections can deeply reward that part of the human that thrives on
        such tasks, can reawaken the exploratory excitement of intellectual growth,
        and deepen emotional response and epiphany. Brooks Landon's review, in
        Science Fiction Studies #61 (http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/land61.htm),
        of Gareth Branwyn's and Peter Sugarman's <strong><em>Cyberpunk: A Do-It-Yourself
        Guide to the Future, </em></strong><a href="#21">[21]</a> with
        its many references to seminal hypertext works, is an excellent place
        to begin exploring hypertext fiction. </p>
      <p>As an example, <em>Queen City Jazz </em><a href="#22">[22]</a>,
        my first novel, was conceived in 1990 as a hypertext novel before such
        technologies were available to the public. The jazz, ragtime, Tin Pan
        Alley, American visual art, comics, and novels referenced therein are
        presently referenced only by words. Thus, the full extent of their evocation
        is limited to those who, at one time, actually experienced the referenced
        work. In addition, it was a nonlinear work forced into the constraints
        of linearity by the limits, at that time, of the publishing process.
        I laid out many of the chapters around me in a circle, and decided on
        the sequence that seemed to make the most narrative sense, but it was
        only one interpretation among many possibilities. Transforming QCJ into
        a hypertext work (ignoring the massive cost of obtaining the rights to
        do so) would enhance the experience of this novel immeasurably. The uses
        of technology as regards perception are unlimited. Artistic paradigms
        might change completely when they begin to infiltrate the public in more
        intimate, more biologically entwined, ways. </p>
      <p>This vision of science fiction as the next modality of human growth,
        the ultimate realization of the Twentieth Century's movement through
        Surrealism, Modernism, and Postmodernism, all of which were linked to
        science and to changes in how and what we were able to perceive - the
        flattening of time through the telegraph, for instance - may be poised
        to completely change the face of literature and the intensity of the
        literary experience. This is only one small facet of the newnesses we
        will soon be able to experience, out of an unlimited range of newnesses
        both within ourselves and in our environment. In the coming era, as we
        gain ways to manipulate our very biology, human character might well
        and truly change, and are arts will reflect, and perhaps participate
        in, these changes. &nbsp; </p>
      Science fiction points the way in which the two cultures of science and
      literature, which represent a schizophrenic split in humanity's use of
      information, might merge, and create new possibilities in the nature of
      consciousness itself.

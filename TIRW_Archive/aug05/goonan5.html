      <p> At the same time, Freud's concept of the Unconscious took the place
        of God. Modern literature, like Freud, looked inward for the first time
        beyond social scrims, to the unconscious, the pre-conscious, the not-so-prettily-formed-and-edited
  conscious basis of thought, dreams, and action. It began to examine territory
  previously reserved for poets and philosophers. It tried to get down to what
  senses actually perceive and piece together to form the still-there "I," contrasting
  with the latter-day Postmodern "not-I," the fractured I, the empty place inside
  that past ages believed so immutable: &nbsp; the soul. &nbsp; </p>
       
      <p>The soul--or at least, the sense of a person, nebulous though that person/soul
        may be--still exists in much modern literature, particularly in Woolf's.
        But it is accepted as being human, rather than God-related, and in this
        it is something new in the world, or at least, something not much seen
        since the Greeks. Pulled loose from God, known to have sprung not from
        heaven but from accidental combinations of matter, this essence of humanity
        is a new thing, an object that can be observed from the inside. Every
        person is seen not as a cog in society but as a complete and mysterious
        individual whose motivations and actions come from a place unseen. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Modern literature is an attempt to get at the assemblage of the thing,
        and story, like the humans and the rest of the natural world, at this
        point becomes infinitely more complex. When the ideas propelling the
        Twentieth Century's scientific and intellectual direction were being
        formed, humans were definitely not seen as a blank slate, as Pinker would
        have it. In the art of the early Twentieth Century, the self is something.
        The Moderns want to find out what that self is, to excavate and reveal
        the self, not fill it up or smother it with predigested ideas. However,
        the soul, or whatever one wants to call the sense of one's own interiority,
        now finds new territory: &nbsp; not God, but science and technology. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Modernism is exterior as well as interior; the wonder and the speculation
        extend in all directions. </p>
      <p>"Away and away the airplane shot, till it was nothing but a bright spark;
        an aspiration; a concentration; a symbol (so it seemed to Mr. Bentley,
        vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich) of man's soul; of
        his determination, thought Mr. Bently, sweeping round the cedar tree,
        to get outside his body, beyond his house, by means of thought, Einstein,
        speculations, mathematics, Mendelian theory--away the airplane shot." <a href="#13">[13]</a> </p>
      <p>Woolf, Joyce, Eliot, Stein, and Proust access what might be called a
        halo of consciousness, comprised of all that the history of human culture
        has to offer, and all that time's immediacy imprints upon the senses.
        The characters in their books realize that they must work harder to make
        sense of things, because the previous comfortable sense of what life
        is has been eclipsed by irrefutable discoveries about the natural world.
        A sense of freedom, wonder, and potential pervades their work, as well
        as the despair communicated by Woolf and Eliot and Lawrence which has
        to do with the realization that all of the darkness of the world--war,
        economic insufficiencies, and even interpersonal pain, are not created
        or mediated by God.  Instead, they are entirely human creations, or at
        least, manifestations of humanity previously blamed on supernatural agencies. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, Pinker argues that humans require what he calls "beauty" of
        their art, and claims studies show that beauty means recognizable landscapes
        and stories with a beginning, middle and end. He claims that Modern literature
        forswore such artifice in favor of another approach. However, this accusation
        could more supportably be leveled at Postmodernism. Most works of Modern
        literature, from <em>Ulysses </em>to <em>Mrs. Dalloway, </em> have beginnings,
        middles, and ends, although the middles swell to include, because of
        the nature of closely observed consciousness, a vast array of remembered,
        invented, or imagined time. Moreover, the point of what one is reading
        might not be quite as didactically imposed upon the reader as in other
        literatures. But, certainly, there is something about Modern literature
        which caused Thomas Hardy to observe, "They've changed everything now
        . . . there used to be a beginning and a middle and an end." <a href="#14">[14]</a> &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Human preference for certain forms or thoughts does not confer any particular
        value on such forms or thoughts. Most humans prefer to believe that God
        exists; a universe with God in it seems to be a more beautiful and perfect
        and even more sensible conclusion, for them. Like belief in God, the
        preference for recognizable landscapes in art and simple stories springs
        from our biological past--as does everything about us. This does not mean
        that we are therefore, as Pinker would have it, incapable of appreciating
        and assimilating purely imaginary or intellectualized combinations of
        information. Our biology underlies everything we think and do, including
        our appreciating forms of art that he seems not to enjoy. A propensity
        to develop or fall into any particular pattern of thought or way of looking
        at reality does not mean these patterns are useful, fruitful, or true.
        Even mathematicians concede that their abstract thoughts, in the end,
        might not necessarily be universally true. In the case of art, though,
        which could be said to be unnecessary (like belief in God) in terms of
        living one's life, people do have a choice, which they exercise: &nbsp; probably
        ninety-nine percent of literature that is published today is traditional
        rather than Postmodern or even Modern. </p>
      <p>Perhaps because it is an examination of abstract thoughts rather than
        anything replicable and outside of ourselves, the study of literature
        seems like a dead end to a lot of people. However, it can be revelatory
        in very satisfying ways. &nbsp; </p>
       
      <p>Stefan Collini, in his 1998 introduction to <em>The Two Cultures </em>,
        points out that critics and academics are actually the "scientists" of
        literature, in that they study the organized manifestations of human
        minds. The necessity of being an initiate in order to appreciate the
        artform fully is implicit in all literature. Just because many of us
        can read does not mean that we have, are capable of having, or would
        even want to have, the same kind of reading experience as everyone else.
        We differ in our intellectual hungers and abilities. The distance between
        high and low art is predicated on the participant having privileged knowledge
        in order to understand and appreciate high art, and on low art being
        something that a relatively unsophisticated reader could enjoy. In this
        sense, the vaunted flattening of the world in Modernism, and in Postmodernism's
        incorporation of low and high, are somewhat illusory. </p>
      <p>If literature is a mirror of consciousness, then the changes that have
        taken place in the literature of the twentieth century mirrors changes
        in, if not consciousness itself, then in the contents of our shared social
        consciousness as determined by history--two devastating world wars fueled
        by ideological differences--and in technological changes such as the
        birth of the atomic bomb. In fact, I would postulate (and many have probably
        done so) that the bare fact of the existence of the atomic bomb gave
        birth to Postmodernism in all of its diversity. Another change in our
        understanding of consciousness, and concurrent changes in literary fashion,
        has to do with our ever-expanding understanding of biochemistry, and
        questions about how biochemistry engenders consciousness. &nbsp; </p>
      Pinker claims that science now shows that personality is, for the most
      part, an irreducible and inescapable given. Agreeing that we are assigned
      personality through our genetic makeup does not change our individual,
      conscious experience of reality, but the literature of today certainly
      reflects an individual becoming infinitely more complex as matter becomes
      more finely grained, less and less visible to the naked or uninformed eye,
      more puzzling. Consciousness is decreasingly seen as a matter of id and
      ego, and increasingly seen as a function of biochemistry. Personality and
      consciousness, in today's popular and scientific view, are manifestations
      that are not under the control of a central principal, whether that principal
      is called God or the individual. Instead, the fragmentation of matter possible
      when atomic energy is unleashed is mirrored in the fragmentation of the  human
      being. And if we can blame our genes for that which we count as faults
      of character (antisocial behavior, a propensity to violence, rape, or murder,
      or even simple rudeness), responsibility for our behavior could be claimed
      to be at an end. Philosophy has wrestled for centuries with the question
      of whether we have free will, and various waves of scientific research
      in the past fifty years seem to say, "No." We still have no final consensus.

  Kathleen Ann Goonan </p>
      <p> This article explores the connections between language, literature,
        and consciousness. The first section discusses the possible origins of
        literature. Section two focuses on the literature of the twentieth century
        and how it reflects a change in the way reality was perceived by a great
        portion of the scientifically and culturally informed public. It includes
        a discussion of C.P. Snow's &quot;The Two Cultures&quot; lecture given
        at Cambridge in 1959, which explicated a split between the ways in which
        science and literature perceived reality after Einstein's revolutionary
        early papers, and relates this to Stephen Pinker's contention, in The
        Blank Slate , that the trends of Modernism and Postmodernism have impeded
        the scientific sophistication of both the general reading public and
        academe. The conclusion points to science fiction as an important literature,
        which links these, two cultures. </p>

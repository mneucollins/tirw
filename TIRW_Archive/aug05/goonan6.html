      <p> If we were to visualize ideas about the origin of personality and how
        they affect literature, the pre-Moderns were at the center of a series
        of concentric circles. The Moderns were a lot of individual circles immersed
        in the same soup, bent on turning that soup into something individual
        through the medium of their consciousness. The Postmoderns are books/whole
        universes giving forth signals that may or may not reach some target,
        and in which the target can then interpret as they wish, find what meaning
        she can, depending on what she brings to the work. But the meaning has
      not necessarily been deliberately assembled by the author. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Postmodernism is substantially different than previous artistic attempts
        to represent or fathom reality. "Realistic fiction presupposed chronological
        time as the medium of a plotted narrative, an irreducible individual
        psyche as the subject of its characterization, and above all, the ultimate
        concrete reality of things as the object and rationale of its description." <a href="#15">[15]</a>        The
        concept of reality as something that everyone agrees upon has given way
        to the idea that one's own point of view yields a singular and ever-changing
        reality which no one else can share in its entirety. This ever-changing
        and unique point of view apprehends and interprets the literary object.
        Italo Calvino states, "The spirit in which one reads is decisive: &nbsp; it
        is up to the reader to see to it that literature exerts its critical
        force, and this can occur independently of the author's intention." <a href="#16">[16]</a> </p>
      <p>One manifestation of this movement is the attempt to leave authoring
        to the reader. &nbsp; This impulse, though, can never be purely executed.
        When Borroughs arranged his cut-ups, he was still acting as an author.
        The negation of the author is just a sleight-of-hand, another technique,
        with roots in Twentieth Century Modernism, presaged by Surrealism. We
        cannot help authoring meaning in our lives, and when meaning fails, often
        we cannot survive its loss. We read meaning and connections into the
        most random events, a biological predilection upon which Postmodernism
        capitalizes. Burroughs is showing us that this is the case. We even invest
        meaninglessness with meaning; nihilism and existentialism are isms that
        give form to various philosophies and lifestyles. We cannot escape ourselves. </p>
      <p>Postmodernist works still assume that a centralized single consciousness/reader
        is assimilating what is put forth. If we sit down with the intent to
        disarrange our senses with a Postmodern novel, the experience resembles
        the enjoyment of an acquired taste as for an exotic cheese. Some people
        take to it; some people don't. </p>
      <p>Despite this, Postmodern literature is more overtly self-conscious than
        modern literature. Instead of dealing mostly with emotion, it is intellectual
        in nature. Postmodern literature often attempts to mirror sensory input
        rather than interpret it, rather than rearrange and infuse it with author-bound
        meaning. But the writing practices of Kerouac - arguably a bridge to
        the Postmodern - in the fifties and sixties were not much different than
        those of Thomas Wolfe in the twenties and thirties. Both simply stuck
        a real or metaphorical roll of paper in the typewriter and wrote without
        regard for structure: &nbsp; the author, in their work, is all. </p>
      <p>In his Postmodern masterpiece, <em>Hopscotch, </em><a href="#17">[17]</a> Cortazar
        goes half the distance. Within the book are chapters in which characters
        interact, as is normal in all novels. If read chronologically, the chapters
        tell one story. Cortazar places jumps within his narrative, though; he
        includes an invitation to read the chapters in a different order - one
        created by him - and, further, invites the reader to assemble their own
        novel from these tableaus. The fragments of meaning are tableaus freed
        from time which can be accessed and rearranged according to the desires
        of the reader; shuffled to create new motives for the actions of the
        characters as well as different outcomes to their philosophical dilemmas,
        which are quite real in terms of affecting them in life-and-death ways. </p>
      <p>Deconstruction and semiotics are, perhaps, extensions of the examination
        of consciousness. It could be argued that most philosophers and religious
        thinkers of the past would be scientists today, because they wanted to
        know what was going on. Huge swaths of religious and philosophical thought
        of the past has been rendered irrelevant by science because we have enhanced
        our knowledge of world with tools capable of sensing that which is too
        far or too small or otherwise beyond our capability to sense without
        tools. We have learned that pure thought, without the physical facts,
        is not a strong enough tool to use to understand ourselves and our environment. </p>
      <p>I submit that there is a literary alternative that bridges the rift
        between science and literature and takes seriously all that we have learned,
        in the past century, about ourselves and our surroundings: &nbsp; science
        fiction. </p>
      <p>C.P. Snow, in <em>The Two Cultures, </em>states, "The clashing point
        of two subjects, two disciplines, two cultures . . . Ought to produce
        creative chances. In the history of mental activity, that has been where
        some of the break-throughs came. The chances are there now. But they
        are there, as it were, in a vacuum, because those of the two cultures
        can't talk to each other." <a href="#18">[18]</a> </p>
      <p>Science fiction is a literature which takes advantage of this creative
        chance. It is the one literature that takes into account the fact that
        we live in an age technologically quite different than that of our grandparents
        and postulates possible differences that might change humanity in the
        future--including changes in consciousness. In <em>Distress: &nbsp; A
        Novel, </em><a href="#19">[19]</a>Greg Egan envisions
        a change in consciousness which might emerge were we to actually understand
        physical reality in its totality via a Theory of Everything, and his
        characters, and thus the reader, experiences this change--a good example
        of the power of literature. </p>
      <p>Like Modern and Postmodern literature, science fiction often requires
        a trained mind to fully appreciate its nuances. Because of this, the
        field has isolated itself from the masses. However, it holds the most
        promise as a literature for those who truly want to think about what
        is happening in the totality of the world, not just in the arenas of
        words and emotions. Science fiction speculates about possible futures
        and examines such futures from a philosophical point of view. It is an
        acquired taste, but so are any of the sciences, mathematics, Modernism,
        Postmodernism, Shakespeare, and poetry. </p>
      <p>This brings me to the final part of this paper, which is concerned with
        healing the breach between the two cultures. </p>
       
      <p>Samuel Delany has defined science fiction as (to paraphrase),"That which
        I say is science fiction when I point to it." In other words, it has
        a chameleonlike ability to use any literary form or to experiment with
        new ones; it can be as subtle and intense as Woolf, as delicate as Proust,
        as overt as Dickens. Those in the field try in vain to define science
        fiction. Attempts to create new marketing labels rise and fall. Various
        works could be labeled, if the term science fiction had never existed,
        as postmodern, experimental, apocalyptic, horror, high literature, fantasy,
        hard-boiled crime, romance, speculative, interstitial, nonlinear. This
        messiness seems evidence of its vitality. Often, science or some change
        due to technical fields is foregrounded, but it is not unusual to find
        science fiction in which the science or technology is a deeply submerged
        given, and the work is instead entirely character-driven. When we can
        download a work into our brain and experience it in visual, musical,
        verbal, literary, pattern, or other modes, when it can be parsed, rearranged,
        and reveal new interactions, we will indeed be experiencing reality in
        an entirely new fashion. This interaction is probably not as far in the
        future, as one might think. The enabling technologies are rapidly coming
        to birth, often as processes to help the disabled or as research delving
        into the roots of the process of sensorial assimilation, and will eventually
        mature into marketable products. </p>

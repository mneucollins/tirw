      <p>The Two Cultures </p>
      <p>But language is slippery, non-objective; not easily revealing repeatedly
        verifiable information, as does science. It is not even composed of irreducible
        symbols, and is, in fact, completely composed of metaphor. Words stand
        for something else; the Oxford English Dictionary is simply a compilation
        of exhaustive lists of examples of word usage, and the astonishing mutability
        thereof, through time. In the timestream of words, meaning ebbs, flows,
        changes. Perhaps this has something to do with the present splintered
        state of affairs between what C.P. Snow called, in his 1959 Rede lecture
        at Cambridge, "The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution." <a href="#2">[2]</a> &nbsp; His
        subject was the difference between those who study words--which are exclusively
        the product of the human mind, and the shifting ways in which they can
        be assembled--and those who study the rest of nature. To describe what
        they have observed, scientists have invented new languages and borrowed
        the language of mathematics. But until recently, the study of consciousness
        was not seriously attempted by science. With the advent of the attempt
        to quantify consciousness, an intersection of these two cultures is not
        only useful, but inevitable. </p>
      <p>Snow, a research scientist who worked with Lord Rutherford at the Cavendish
        Laboratory in the 1930's as well as a successful novelist, states in
        his talk, "Literary intellectuals (are) at one pole--at the other scientists,
        and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the
        two, a gulf of mutual incomprehension - sometimes (particularly among
        the young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack of understanding.
        They have a curious distorted image of each other. Their attitudes are
        so different that, even on the level of emotion, they can't find much
        common ground." <a href="#3">[3]</a> </p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Peter Watson, in <em>The Modern Mind </em>, <a href="#4">[4]</a> points
        out that although the arts incorporated the sciences during the first
        half of the twentieth century, art did not feed into the sciences in
        any meaningful way. Though it now seems obvious that this should be the
        case, this split is actually a new thing in history. Information and
        connections in the sciences gained phenomenal velocity beginning in the
        late nineteenth century. It was not until decades later that anyone in
        the sciences even tried to communicate the depth and importance of what
        they were about, although the fruits of what they were learning, in the
        form of technological change, were everywhere. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>In his book <em>The Blank Slate, </em><a href="#5">[5]</a> Stephen
        Pinker blames the Modernists and Postmodernists for the insularity of
        the humanities in academe, for the fact that the "two cultures" of science
        and the humanities have grown so far apart. He also states that, in the
        main, those in the humanities would have the hardest time accepting that
        there is a genetic basis for much of who we are and what we do. He takes
        particular note of Virginia Woolf's 1924 essay, "Character in Fiction," (though
        he references "Mr. Bennett and Bennett and Mrs. Brown," an essay which,
        in its originally published form in 1923, did not contain this phrase)
        in which she states . . . "on or about December 10 1910 human nature
        changed." <a href="#6">[6]</a> Pinker says, "She was
        referring to the new philosophy of Modernism that would dominate the
        elite arts and criticism for much of the twentieth century, and whose
        denial of human nature was carried over with a vengeance to Postmodernism,
        which seized control in its later decades... Woolf was wrong. Human nature
        did not change in 1910, or in any year thereafter." <a href="#7">[7]</a> Pinker
        assumes that "the philosophy of Modernism" was a largely artificial movement
        made up out of whole cloth by Woolf and other arbiters of taste--essayists,
        critics, and artists. </p>
      <p>The situation is actually a bit more complex. Although Pinker insists
        that, because of their evolved biological traits, humans prefer art that
        includes understandable landscapes, recognizable human faces, and novels
        that tell stories in the traditional fashion, it seems obvious that whatever
        Modernism and Postmodernism are, appreciation of them springs from biological
        roots as much as does appreciation of simpler modes of communication.
        He downplays another interpretation of the changes in the human psyche
        which Modernism concretely manifested - the fact that, due to changes
        in knowledge about ourselves and the world, and the use of new technologies
        which emerged from this knowledge, our reflection of these changes in
        art, literature, and architecture became radically new. Art emerges from
        humans, from some mysterious stratum intermingled with consciousness
        in ways which sometimes elude direct awareness. Art that is purely intellectual
        and calculated rarely finds as large an audience as did Modernism in
        all of its manifestations. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Pinker's blame of literature for the intellectual impasse at which we
        find ourselves, and in particular the contention that Modernism and Postmodernism "caused" this
        impasse, are in some respects straw men. Science and the humanities differ
        in fundamental ways, particularly in the fashion in which they approach
        fact and knowing. Yet, it is in journals such as the one in which this
        paper appears that differences between "The Two Cultures" can be discussed
        so that there can begin to be a melding of the richnesses and insights
        of these two cultures, to everyone's benefit. Just as scientific progress
        in many fields, including that of consciousness studies, is crippled
        by lack of communication between specialized, but extremely knowledgeable
        people, so the idea that human progress in all academic fields can be
        given a boost by a cross-culturization of information seems plausible.
        It might, therefore, be useful to have more information about the change
        Woolf noticed, and how the change--if not in human character, then perhaps
        a change in what people thought of as human character, came about. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Literature reflects zeitgeist; the spirit of the age is embedded in
        every literature that has ever been produced. Literary forms change as
        societal views change. Our modes of thought and representations of such
        are directly related to the culture in which they arise, whether that
        be medieval Germany or Postmodern America. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In 1913, seven years before Woolf published her observations, the Italian
        futurist F.T. Marinetti wrote about </p>
      <p>"...The complete renewal of human sensibility brought about by the great
        discoveries of science. Those people who today make use of the telegraph,
        the telephone, the phonograph, the train, the bicycle, the motorcycle,
        the automobile, the ocean liner, the dirigible, the aeroplane, the cinema,
        the great newspaper (synthesis of a day in the world's life) do not realize
        that the various means of communication, transportation and information
        have a decisive influence on the psyche." <a href="#8">[8]</a> </p>
      <p>Even Henry James suggested that it is impossible for us to know how
        anyone in an age previous to the age when technology changed the human
        experience of time and space actually saw the world. And he further stated,
        in 1904, that "The notion that even the truest formula may be a human
        device and not a literal transcript has dawned on us." <a href="#9">[9]</a> </p>
      <p>To Virginia Woolf, the Post-Impressionist Exhibit of 1910 as well as
        the changes she observed in fiction were a testament to the changes that
        new scientific discoveries had brought about not in consciousness itself,
        which of course did not change, but in the contents of consciousness.
        A new lens through which to view the world and human nature had come
        into existence, and this new way of seeing time, space, matter, and human
        nature, as well as the new technologies thereby spawned, necessarily
        changed humanity, as Marinetti observed. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Moderns (who for the use of this paper are mainly James, Woolf,
        Proust, Joyce, Stein, and Eliot, though there were many more, both major
        and minor) realized that great changes were afoot; they lived through
        them and had the need to express their observations. </p>

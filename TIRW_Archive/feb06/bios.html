            Alexis (Lex) Bhagat is a logomaniac from New York City. &nbsp; After several experiments with therapeutic silence in Vermont (and inspried by the Neoist &quot;Art Strike&quot;), he burned all of his previous writings on December 21st, 1994 and began a 1-year &quot;Poetry Strike,&quot; during which time he became bewitched by mircophones, recorders and radios. Charmed, he fell into a dark and lonely gutter of audiophilia, emerging a decade later to find comraderie with the <em>August Sound Coalition </em>webcasting collective and shelter under the transmission arts umbrella of <em>Free103point9. </em> Notable solo sound compositions include <em>I used to walk all the way from Pleasantdale... </em> (2001), <em>Whitman Death Songs </em>(2002), <em>Lecture regarding Sound as Art </em> (2003), <em>Bandshell Ghost </em>&nbsp; and <em>Lecture on the Possibilitiy of Life without the Sun </em>(both 2004.) </p>
          <p>Since 2002, he has been in collaboration with Gregory Gangemi and Jason Quarles on Sound Generation- a collection of interviews with 24 contemporary sound artists, cut up into a polyvocal colloquy. &nbsp; (Forthcoming from Autonomedia.)  His tangential musings and investigations on sound and liberation are periodically disseminated through his occasional publication, <em>Tactical Sound.<br>

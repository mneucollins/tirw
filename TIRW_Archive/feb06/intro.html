            <span class="style3">by Ben Basan </span><br>
  <br>
          <span class="style1">Rapid advances in and mass popularity of  visual technology certainly contributed to the way in which visuality has  permeated the cultural imaginary of the twentieth (and twenty-first) century.  By some accounts, there may have been a psychological or historical <em>need </em>for the ascension of the retinal sense  and dominance of visual technology. If, as Marita Amm proposes, the nineteenth  century was the &lsquo;century of the eye,&rsquo; then the legacy only deepened in the  twentieth century to include the eye&rsquo;s homophonic relations. </span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            I do not intend for this pun merely to  invoke the rise of psychology; the additional connotation here is forming of  the I via the eye. That is, in keeping with Walter Benjamin among others, with  the advent of photography and the motion picture, the powerfully affective  qualities of the &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; visual image and the new ability to  capture on film aspects of everyday experience  unavailable to ordinary sense perception have given rise to a radically altered  vision of the self.&nbsp; This would be  the linguistically constructed self, the bodiless self so immersed in its own  seeing that its interpretative facility is monopolized by the retinal. So  thorough is this monopoly that when confronted with non-visual sensory challenging  works by artists such as Lygia Clark, Ernesto Neto, or Arakawa and Gins who are  working, broadly, with phenomenological issues, or aural, sound-based  installations like Christina Kubisch, Edwin Van Der Heide, or Ed Osborn&rsquo;s sonic  environments,&nbsp; it understands them  first in terms of their visual qualities. </span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            Scrutiny of the dominance of the visual  is not a contemporary phenomenon in art by any means. Duchamp&rsquo;s <em>Sixteen  Miles of String </em>(1942)  is but a single example in the influential artist&rsquo;s body of work that  challenges the visual - consider also the visual tropes, such as the Ocular Witness,  in the <em>Large Glass</em>.  However, over the last thirty to forty years the seeming hegemony of the visual  has come under the scalpel of critical discourse and practice that brings  closer attention the sensorium and its individual senses. While it would be a  gross oversimplification to suggest that sound art is an offshoot of such  concerns, or even a response to them, sound art contributes to the debate  directly and indirectly. Douglas Kahn&rsquo;s phenomenal <em>Noise Water Meat: A History  of Sound in the Arts, </em>for  example, retells a significant portion of the modernist and post-modernist  avant-garde aesthetic in terms of the significance of sound. The book is by no means just  a revolutionized musicology; rather it foregrounds and uncovers the history of  hearing and sound production that has been overshadowed by the rhetoric of the  visual. Moreover, some of the work of another contributor to this issue of The  Iowa Review Web, Paul DeMarinis, excavates old, mostly nineteenth century,  sound technology and puts it to use as contemporary cultural and technological  comment. </span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            Indeed, technology is an important factor  in much sound art and the history of sound, though its role is by no means easy  to encapsulate, as I think all of the pieces in this issue demonstrate. Just as  film and visual technology have been used to investigate imperceptible  phenomena, so too has audio technology. The frequently retold story of John  Cage entering the anechoic chamber at Harvard for the first time when he could  hear the pulsing of his blood and the activity of his nervous system is but one  example of the use of technology (in this case the paradoxical application  of sound-proofing to enable hearing) to <em>hear</em> small, imperceptible sounds. Perhaps a more pertinent  historical example would be Cage&rsquo;s <em>Cartridge Music, </em>which required &ldquo;microphones and  cartridges...connected to amplifiers that go to loudspeakers [because] the  majority of sounds produced [are] small and require amplification in order to  be heard&rdquo; (qtd. in Kahn, 194). Certainly, one aspect of Ed Osborn&rsquo;s <em>Harvester</em> is the use of microphones to produce  from movement and proximity sounds from ostensible silence. Such use of  technology to &lsquo;pick-up&rsquo; the normally inaudible, in fact, ties into a much  longer history of sound related technology like Thomas Watson&rsquo;s (Alexander  Graham Bell&rsquo;s assistant) use of a telephone circuit to pick up the crackle he  claimed contained voices from another planet.</span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            In Brandon La Belle&rsquo;s piece in this  issue, sound technology, a boom box in this case, is shown to have become both  a community and identity-forming <em>instrument</em>. By focusing on the social and reception  side of sound technology, La Belle also opens up discourse to the significance  sound plays in our ordinary lives - and not always sound we want to hear - in  contrast to the usual focus on the visual. The contribution of sound in our  day-to-day lives is a point seldom put to critical use. Perhaps the best known,  but not by any means <em>well known,</em> insight into this aspect of sound is in Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Arcades Project</em> in the frequent allusions to Dickens&rsquo;s  need to be amongst the sounds and noises of the city in order to write. </span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            Working another angle on the social is  Alexis Baghat&rsquo;s piece on anti-authoritarian writing. This piece, part of his  &lsquo;Lecture&rsquo; series, uses a number of digital manipulations to call into question  the written text. Unlike the arguments privileging speech over writing, Baghat  takes on the notion of inscription more generally with such alterations and  layering of his, and another unidentified woman&rsquo;s, recorded speech as  simultaneously a contributing factor to the presentation of the piece, an  effacement of the recorded voice, and a means through which his speech is  actually made. The other audio piece from ADACHI Tomomi is also an experiment  into vocal effacement and meaning, though in this case, as the titles (in  Japanese) humorously suggest, it is effacement that comes close to being  something else - an octopus, for example.</span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            The pieces in this issue of The Iowa  Review Web are by no means a complete representation of the various trends in  sound art. My hope was to at least represent a few threads and to hopefully  bring to the attention of all of us who have a stake in New Media that sound is  not just a decoration or a vehicle to add flavor to a piece (though it can be  that too!). I am aware of the oddity of critiquing vision at the beginning of  this piece and then to have two of the gallery artist&rsquo;s works in video. On that  point, I simply want to emphasize that to critique the dominance of the visual  is not to want it done away with. Rather, what interests me is a non-hierarchy  of the senses - something I believe all the gallery pieces achieve.</span></p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="style1"><br>
            In closing, some words of thanks are due to  a fair number of people who have helped to make this issue come together.  First, I would like to thank all of the contributors to this issue who have  been extremely patient as we faced delay after delay. As readers may have  noticed, The Iowa Review Web has not published since last November. We have had  numerous difficulties with the technical aspects of this issue and thanks for  overcoming these are due to Jon Winet, Michael Peter, Craig Dietrich, and  everyone else in Intermedia at The University of Iowa. Finally, while only  &lsquo;doing their jobs&rsquo;, Thom Swiss, Merrie Snell, and Brittany Duff have all been  instrumental in getting this issue together.</span></p>

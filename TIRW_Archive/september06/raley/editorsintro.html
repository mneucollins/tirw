       For  a sickening moment he tried to retain his old up-and-down orientation, his body  attempting to right itself, searching for the gravity that wasn&rsquo;t there. Then  he forced himself to change his view. He was hurtling toward a wall. That was  down. And at once he had control of himself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;  Orson Scott Card, <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> </p>
          </pre>
          <p class="style5">How do we read a text that removes the stabilizing spatial  coordinates of the page and no longer maintains a top-centric and left-centric  orientation?&nbsp; How do we read texts  that do not simply simulate dimension but in fact materialize and operate on  the z-axis?&nbsp; Here, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0812550706/ref=s9_asin_title_1/104-0687894-8604767">Ender&rsquo;s  Game</a></em> is suggestive:&nbsp; what Ender Wiggin has to learn about  the null-gravity Battle Room is that it requires a fundamental reorientation of  spatial perspective.&nbsp; Indeed, the  players&rsquo; successful navigation and battle victories depend on their capacity to  adapt to a space with a different spatial logic.&nbsp; So, too, a three-dimensional text &ndash; whether it be presented  in the immersive reading environment of a Cave, a game space, a QuickTime  video, or a Javascript poem &ndash; requires an adaptive flexibility that we might  even call a new mode of reading, a &ldquo;deep reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left" class="style5">My thinking about the theme of this issue &ndash; Writing.3D &ndash; did  not begin with a consideration of video installations or gaming spaces, as one  would perhaps initially expect, but with a consideration of a set of works that  gestured toward the realization of three dimensions within the space of a  poetic text.&nbsp; In David Knoebel&rsquo;s  Java series, <em><a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/cpwis.html">Click Poetry:  Words in Space</a></em> (2001), for example, &ldquo;<a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/ohanf/oh.html">Oh</a>&rdquo; creates the illusion  of sphericality; the words in &ldquo;<a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/walkdont/index.html">Walkdont</a>&rdquo; spin on  the subsidiary axes of an invisible mobile; and &ldquo;<a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/fineview/fineview.html">A Fine View</a>&rdquo;  reproduces the cinematic illusion of 3D by miming the roll-out of the prologue  to <em>Star Wars</em>.&nbsp; <img width="144" height="147" src="editorsintro_clip_image002.png" align="left" hspace="9">Ted Warnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ubu.com/contemp/warnell/files/codepo.htm">Codepoetry</a>&rdquo;  brings the suggestion of depth and three dimensionality to the fore with its  intricate embedding of a symbolic z-axis within the work.&nbsp; The frame of the visual poem appears as  the single face of a cube, each letter of the words &ldquo;code poetry&rdquo; laid out  along invisible gridlines and marked with a coordinate.&nbsp; Not only do the letters themselves take  the form of a &ldquo;z,&rdquo; but graphing the coordinates themselves reveals the form of  another &ldquo;z.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1] </a>&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5">In this special issue of <em>TIR Web</em> we will see a collection of texts in which three  dimensionality is suggested and some in which it is actually realized.&nbsp; We will also see different formal  strategies for establishing focal points and textual sequences, for helping the  reader to orient herself to the interface.&nbsp; In Knoebel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heart Pole,&rdquo; for example, the word &ldquo;breathe&rdquo;  is the stabilizing &ldquo;pole&rdquo; that remains perpendicularly linked to the primary  block of text.&nbsp; Readers of Aya  Karpinksa&rsquo;s &ldquo;mar puro&rdquo; click on the different phrases to pull them into the foreground  and re-center the text.&nbsp; Even with  the presence of these stabilizing elements, the question before us is  this:&nbsp; how do we approach and  critically assess reading interfaces that abandon the spatial assumptions of  codex?&nbsp; Espen Aarseth, Katherine  Hayles and others have articulated the need to develop critical practices and  semiotics particular to the technological substrate of the text.&nbsp; It follows, then, that we now also have  a need for aesthetic and critical frameworks for text-based virtual environments  and to account for reading in different multi-dimensional spaces.&nbsp; There is by now a rich critical  tradition of reading spaces in a different sense:&nbsp; reading structures in terms of rhetoric and  &ldquo;archisemiotics,&rdquo; seeing meaning and significance in spatial design (Mike  Davis, Fredric Jameson).&nbsp; However,  what is now required is a different kind of exploration of the spatial  properties of texts. &nbsp;The unit of  poetic analysis has shrunk from line to word to letter and now we have need of  another unit:&nbsp; the  three-dimensional projecting plane.</p>
          <p class="style5">Earlier issues of <em>TIR Web</em> have featured <em><a href="http://iowareview.uiowa.edu/TIRW/TIRW_Archive/tirweb/feature/cave/">Screen</a></em>, a Cave project executed by Noah Wardrip-Fruin,  Robert Coover, and a design/build team at Brown University.&nbsp; To recap:&nbsp; the first reading space within this work resembles that of  print or, more precisely, that of the wall poster.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;traditional, paper-style reading&rdquo; and the static,  conventionally rendered paragraphs invite slow reading and quiet contemplation.&nbsp; Then there is a pronounced ripping sound  and individual words begin to peel off the walls and swarm about at an  increasingly rapid pace.&nbsp; Perhaps  drawing on the corresponding cinematic genre, the transition into 3D space is  designed to surprise.&nbsp; It disrupts  the reading experience to which we have been habituated, as do the sharp sounds  of the spoken words as they tear away from the walls.&nbsp; Thus, the text of <em>Screen</em> is fixed initially in the mode of a linear book; as  the work progresses, the words become literal 3D objects, sculptural and volumetric.&nbsp; This is three dimensionality that plays  off of the traditional two dimensionality of printed text, spatial fluidity  that plays off of the fixed point of view in traditional print-based space.&nbsp; We might think as well of projects such  as the <a href="http://www.hitlabnz.org/route.php?r=prj-view&prj_id=38">Magic  Book</a>, which retains the page as the unit of textual presentation; readers  wearing head-mounted displays see three-dimensional animated scenes &ldquo;pop off  the page and come to life.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5"><em>Screen</em> is also an  instance of what Wardrip-Fruin terms &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dichtung-digital.com/2005/1/Wardrip-Fruin/">playable media</a>&rdquo;:&nbsp; the user can not only touch words with  the data glove but also bat them back onto the wall, somewhat like a semantic  version of Pong.&nbsp; Wardrip-Fruin and  the team speak of three components or levels of reading in the piece:&nbsp; reading conventionally; reading of the  individual words as they peel off the wall and swarm about the user; and  reading of the reformulated text once the words are hit back onto the  wall.&nbsp; These words, however, are  not isolate or sealed off from the rest of the text once they begin to swarm  about.&nbsp; In fact, there is a fourth  type of reading:&nbsp; along the  z-axis.&nbsp; That is, the user does not  simply read the words as they circle around her but she also reads through and  behind them to the text on the walls.&nbsp;  In other words, it is deep reading in this other sense: reading  volumetrically, reading surface to depth and back again.&nbsp; Playable text had earlier been achieved  by interactive video installation &ndash; Tom White and David Small&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/projects/stream/">Stream of Consciousness</a></em> (1998) and Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.camilleutterback.com/textrain.html">Text Rain</a></em> (1999) &ndash; but in the Cave environment, raining, or  swarming, text becomes truly volumetric. </p>
          <p class="style5">The medium and writing techniques inform the thematic  content of <em>Screen</em>.&nbsp; Robert Coover&rsquo;s prologue, transmitted  by positional sound, links the virtual space of the project to the virtual  space of memory.&nbsp; The theme of  memory &ndash; &ldquo;reading as memory&rdquo; &ndash; has partly to do with the fact that memory, like  the letter, can be destroyed; each depends upon the other.&nbsp; So, as the prologue explains, &ldquo;memories  have a way of coming apart on us, losing their certainty/ and when they start  to peel away, we do what we can to push them, bit by bit, back in  place&hellip;.Increasingly they rip apart, blur and tangle with one another and swarm  mockingly about us, threatening us with absence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The swarm &ndash; the paradigmatic figure of conflict for netwar &ndash;  has its own distinctive choreography.&nbsp;  As opposed to the wave, the swarm comes from all directions and  converges on the target &ndash; here the primary reader &ndash; from multiple directions.&nbsp; Swarming suggests a dispersion of force  rather than a concentration.&nbsp;  Moreover, swarming text that is responsive to its environment, that  reconstitutes itself and continues to peel off of the wall into 3D space, has a  &lsquo;natural&rsquo; ecology of its own.&nbsp; <em>Screen</em>, however, &ldquo;does not create a virtual landscape&rdquo; and  thus departs from conventional VR aesthetics, which position the user above a  virtual terrain.&nbsp; <em>Screen</em> is embedded in mimesis to the extent that its  initial reading spaces resemble those of print pages, but it does not invite  total immersion into a simulated natural environment.&nbsp; Its backdrop, rather, is that of a machinic letter space and  the structure of the cube is one that will be replicated in many 3D texts.</p>
          <p class="style5">One of the first projects done in the Cave took the form of  a cube.&nbsp; For &ldquo;<a href="P0003351.JPG">Texts  in Space</a>,&rdquo; Vesper Stockwell, together with programmer Bryan Choung,  developed what has been described as &ldquo;a cube afloat in outer space with text  mapped backwards on it, such that the user was required to enter the cube to  read the text.&rdquo; &nbsp;Another Cave  project, William Gillespie&rsquo;s <em><a href="../gillespie/wordmuseum.html">Word  Museum</a></em>, contains a 3D hypercube,  &ldquo;Letter to Linus,&rdquo; that presents the cube&rsquo;s edges, and not its faces, as the  textual surface (a hypertext version of &ldquo;<a href="http://iowareview.uiowa.edu/TIRW/TIRW_Archive/tirweb/feature/sept/lettertolinus/index.html">Linus</a>&rdquo;  was featured in an earlier <em>TIR Web</em>).&nbsp; Aya Karpinska and Daniel C. Howe&rsquo;s interactive  spatial poetry installation,<em> <a href="http://www.technekai.com/open/index.html">open.ended</a></em> (2004),  features real-time 3D rendering and nested rotating cubes.&nbsp; Depending on the installation form, a  joystick or touchscreen controls the geometric surfaces, which then dynamically  alters the poetic text that appears on them.&nbsp; The joystick and touchscreen, then, facilitate the  transition from 2D to 3D, in effect becoming the means by which the reader  portals into the text.&nbsp; (There is  an interesting conjunction here with the projected design of the controller of  Nintendo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/10/nintendos-final-wii-controller-what-we-know/">Wii</a>,  part-remote and part-wand, which promises to introduce depth perception.)&nbsp; Karpinska and Howe&rsquo;s work is &ldquo;open  ended&rdquo; in the sense that it is time-based, but also in the sense that the  reader has to fill in the semantic gaps.&nbsp;  The x-, y- and z-axes all function as dynamic poetic lines that invite  rather than obstruct hermeneutic decoding (the viewpoint can be subtly adjusted  such that the surface of the inner cube becomes legible).&nbsp; For an analogy, one has to imagine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Arepo_Tenet_Opera_Rotas">Sator</a> square becoming not simply a cube but a set of continually shifting, nested  cubes.&nbsp; In this issue, Dan Waber  and Jason Pimble&rsquo;s cube, <em>five by five</em>,  emphasizes spinning, twirling, and revolving; the placement of a fixed thematic  word at the center of each of the iterations builds on their earlier <em><a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dudley/fellows/lit/Infinity/waber.htm">I,  You, We</a></em>, which situates the viewer, the  &ldquo;I&rdquo; of the poem,&rdquo; inside the center of a translucent cube that can be  continually shifted and rotated.&nbsp;  All of these projects suggest that the cube has become a 3D surface substituting  for the 2D surface of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5">In the preface to <em><a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/cpwis.html">Click Poetry</a></em> (2001), Knoebel self-reflexively comments upon the  reading of poetry in three dimensions and speculates about a landscape  constituted by letters:&nbsp; &ldquo;What if  we could walk among the words of novels and poems?&rdquo;&nbsp; With overtones of the Narnia chronicles as well as Jeffrey  Shaw&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.jeffrey-shaw.net/html_main/show_work.php3?record_id=83">The  Legible City</a></em> (1989-91) and Matthew  Kirschenbaum&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/~mgk3k/lucid/">Lucid  Mapping</a></em> project (1997-98), Knoebel&rsquo;s  query approaches the issue of 3D writing from, as it were, another angle.&nbsp; The question is not simply how we read  texts that lack familiar spatial coordinates but what the significance of such  a text would be.&nbsp; Or, as I put it to  this issue&rsquo;s contributors:&nbsp; in your  writing practice, what is the significance of the letter&rsquo;s becoming three  dimensional?&nbsp; What difference does  it make for current paradigms of reading and our understanding of text?</p>
          <p class="style5">We can first read the spatial turn in the context of Ted  Nelson&rsquo;s visionary proposal for the development of hyper-media<a href="#ftnote3">[2]</a>.  The <em>Screen</em> design team refers to their work as an instance of  &ldquo;spatial hypertext writing,&rdquo; alluding to Nelson&rsquo;s vision of multi-dimensional  media.&nbsp; In Nelson&rsquo;s definition,  hypertext is text that &ldquo;branches or performs on request&rdquo; and StretchText is one  form of hypermedia writing that he envisioned for a throttle-directed computer  console.&nbsp; (The other of course is  discrete, chunk-style hypertext, which we associate with internet-based  architectures.)&nbsp; StretchText was to  do precisely that &ndash; expand or contract on the user&rsquo;s demand &ndash; and while none of  the speculative implementations are cubic, there is no reason to suppose that  it would be limited either to a flat surface or to opaque layers. </p>
          <p class="style5">We can turn to the <em>Screen</em> white paper to locate another claim for the significance of  three-dimensional text:&nbsp; that the  resulting immersive reading experience is not only new but also qualitatively  improved in relation to older new media. &nbsp;Thus the project is said to &ldquo;create new reading experiences,&rdquo;  in relation to the reader&rsquo;s body, &ldquo;a new type of relation to language, and a  new confrontation with text.&rdquo;&nbsp; So,  too, Cave writing workshops are devoted to the production of what is called &ldquo;next-generation  literary experiences.&rdquo;&nbsp; That these  literary experiences should be generational and endeavor to introduce the new  is insightfully suggested by Sandy Baldwin&rsquo;s <em>New Word Order</em>, which appropriates the code from the &ldquo;Half Life&rdquo;  game to generate the readable text that fills virtual rooms<a href="#ftnote3">[3]</a>. &nbsp; In the gaming environment of <em>New  Word Order</em>, the player-reader uses a crow  bar and hand grenades to destroy and reconfigure words in virtual space, words  taken from a Billy Collins poem, sample lines of which read, &ldquo;walk inside the  poem&rsquo;s room/ and feel the walls for a light switch&hellip;.They begin beating it with  a hose/ to find out what it really means.&rdquo;&nbsp; Literalizing the putative violence inherent in poetic  analysis, this is less a reading experience than an anti-reading  experience.&nbsp; Thus the real code  that appears to generate this reading space is not &ldquo;Half-Life&rdquo; but Archibald  MacLeish&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ars Poetica&rdquo;: &ldquo;A poem should not mean/ But be.&rdquo;&nbsp; The art of virtual letters regards  projection itself as complex, belonging both to the avant-garde tradition of  destructivity as well as to the art of reconfiguration.&nbsp; Both <em>Screen</em> and <em>New Word Order</em> invite the user not only to touch the word but also  to reconfigure the spatial dimension of the letter itself.&nbsp; While <em>Screen</em> ends with fallen words, the best efforts of the  reader notwithstanding, <em>New Word Order</em> directly invites the possibility of violent disfiguration.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5">We might now turn to a further aspect of the  three-dimensional letter, which is inscription on complex surfaces and its  corollary, the letter becoming its own complex surface.&nbsp; Here we can turn our attention to two  projects by John Cayley featured in this issue:&nbsp; <em>Lens</em> and <em>Torus</em>.&nbsp; As  Cayley explains in his response to my questions, <em>Lens</em> is an interactive QuickTime piece composed while he  was designing <em>Torus</em>, a larger  work-in-progress for the Cave at Brown.&nbsp;  The word &ldquo;Lens&rdquo; is literally that &ndash; a movable, scalable, seemingly  translucent lens through and on which one can read the four poetic,  epigrammatic stanzas of the work. &nbsp;One of the stanzaic texts &ndash; &ldquo;the letter is a threshold&rdquo; &ndash;  provides further guidelines for reading.&nbsp;  The letter crosses the threshold from the two-dimensional space of  printed text to the three-dimensional space of the virtual word.&nbsp; (Volumetric projection in this work is  achieved by the shifting of scale.)&nbsp;  The material signifier, the form and shape of the letter, is itself a  threshold.&nbsp; The lens is also a  threshold in the sense of a portal; that is, the dynamic word-object &ldquo;lens&rdquo;  functions as a portal into the text <em>Lens</em>.&nbsp; It is the functioning  within <em>Lens</em> that gives the word  &ldquo;lens&rdquo; meaning.&nbsp; This, then, is a  poem with a portal into itself:&nbsp;  quintessentially <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/mediawork/titles/writing/writing_slideshow.html">technotextual</a> in its self-reflexive engagement with its own inscription technologies.&nbsp; To continue, a threshold is also  situated between writer and reader, where both are said to &ldquo;leave some inkling  of the glory they have seen within the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; The threshold then bears material traces of reader and  writer.&nbsp; The writer reaches back  beyond the letter as a single unit to the other, and the meaning of &lsquo;other&rsquo;  fluctuates:&nbsp; the writer and reader  are other but so, too, is the letter. </p>
          <p class="style5">Cayley&rsquo;s critical and aesthetic exploration of the  literalizing of the letter continues in his Cave project <em>Torus</em> (2005- ), of which we here provide partial video  documentation.&nbsp; Like his previous  work <em>Translation</em>, <em>Torus</em> incorporates fragments from English and French  editions of Proust&rsquo;s <em>Swann&rsquo;s Way</em>.&nbsp; The use of Proust suggests both  continuity and a connection with the earlier Cave project, <em>Screen</em>; that is, both are concerned with the relations  between reading and memory and &ldquo;memory as a virtual experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are five textual fragments at any  one time on the vanes of the torus; proximity establishes some relation among  them and they are also dynamically altered with the transliteral letter  substitutions that are Cayley&rsquo;s artistic signature.&nbsp; As with his previous work, there are moments in the torus  when the text is in its &ldquo;natural language state,&rdquo; or, to use the rhetoric of  his <em><a href="http://www.shadoof.net/in/?overboard.html">overboard</a></em>, when the text is &lsquo;on the surface.&rsquo;&nbsp; At these moments, too, the recitation  of the text is quite clear; in other moments the sounds of the recitations are  densely layered and the individual voices difficult to distinguish.&nbsp; The reader can penetrate to the inside  of this three-dimensional text; she can &ldquo;seem to be inside an inside,&rdquo; at which  point the text is silent. </p>
          <p class="style5">Cayley has a long-term critical interest in what he calls  &ldquo;writing for complex surfaces&rdquo;; and the torus, the donut-shaped, closed surface  that is the product of two circles would be precisely that.&nbsp; Invoking non-Euclidean geometry in a virtual  environment situates the letter in and on a three-dimensional space without  edges or vertices.&nbsp; While this  issue outlines a set of projects concerned with the dimensions of reading and  while each of these projects resonates, or seems to resonate, with the other,  there is nonetheless a heterogeneity to these various reading spaces.&nbsp; Whereas Knoebel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heart Pole,&rdquo; for  example, grants readers access to the backs of words, and Gillespie&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="../gillespie/wordmuseum.html">Word  Museum</a>&rdquo; allows readers to look at its word objects and &ldquo;textual sculptures&rdquo;  from behind, Cayley points out that &ldquo;letters in the <em>Torus</em> have no thickness&rdquo;; that is, the reader &ldquo;cannot see  their rear surfaces nor even view them obliquely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the letter is flat but it is inscribed on a surface of  complex folds.&nbsp; We can also  contrast the flatness of the letters in <em>Torus</em> with the volume that words appear to attain in Cave  projects. &nbsp;If words inscribed on  the complex surface of <em>Torus</em> are  without depth, words in the Cave, by contrast, become themselves complex  surfaces.&nbsp; Concrete poetry brought  the critical importance of the three-dimensional language object to the fore in  its exploration of the positioning of words on a surface.&nbsp; Putting concrete poetry into dialogic  relation with Cave projects allows us in part to trace a trajectory from the  assemblage of words on a surface to words themselves becoming complex surfaces.&nbsp; Without insisting upon an absolute  division between writing on the page and text installations, we can say that 3D  allows writing to morph into a material figure.&nbsp; Words take on an object-ness not granted by positionality on  a page.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5">To conclude, I would like to return to the experience of  projection in relation to what I earlier called &ldquo;deep reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <em>Torus</em>, the reader moves virtually through the plane of projection, entering  into the layered portals of the text.&nbsp;  The experience is not only one of the appearance of three-dimensional  projection but of immersion into the three-dimensional letter.&nbsp; It is here that claims for a  phenomenologically new mode of reading are best actualized, pointing towards  what may well be one of the future trajectories of reading itself.&nbsp; </p>

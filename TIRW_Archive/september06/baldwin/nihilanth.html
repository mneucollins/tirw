          <p align="justify"><span class="style5">All games are  played towards the other. The first-person shooter computer games that concern  me are about the destination of my self towards the other. Being in the game is  the placement and occupation of immersive language situations, not necessarily as  destined for discursive production but a heuristic or poetic situation for  addressing otherness.<br>
  My focus here  is immersion, with reference to the deep and dimensional environments of  first-person computer gaming. Immersion in computer space is incoherent. It is  not that I disclose myself to others and we meet as equals. There is not a grid  or surface, a clean and smooth world, across which I encounter others. Such a  space might be filled with challenges, physical obstacles, puzzles, but its  inherent dimensionality and cohesion guarantees that it can be passed over. The  game can be won. This is not immersion. Immersion is lost in the mediacy of  gaming where the outcome is always there and guaranteed, even if the guarantee  is distant and difficult, even if I cannot win but you might. No, immersion is  incoherent and continuous. (The view of immersion I present here is adapted from  my reading of Alan Sondheim&rsquo;s work e.g. Sondheim, 1977.)<br>
&ldquo;Immersion&rdquo; is  completely misunderstood in discussions of new media technologies. Janet Murray  famously describes immersion as an aesthetic phenomenon arising from the way a  medium engages our curiosity and our interest in narrative (Murray, 1999; see  also Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan, 2004). She argues that immersion in digital  media results from spatial and encyclopedia properties. The given-ness of the  three dimensional space and the encyclopedic possibilities of total simulation  are the background conditions for immersion. Murray&rsquo;s view is typical and  closely shared by many theorists of cyberspace. It is as if we begin from a  three-dimensional space and play the game moving through this structure. In  turn, there is a growing tradition of setting words in these spaces as a form  of poetry, as in <a href="http://www.shadoof.net/in/">John Cayley&rsquo;s work</a> or <a href="http://www.ekac.org/holopoetry.html">Eduardo Kac&rsquo;s holopoetry</a>.  Immersion in the three-dimensional environment meets the display of words. On  the one hand, the words become symbols for the codedness of the environment,  reflections on the material and technical base of the immersion. Immersion is  reflection on the tendency of inscription towards symbolic frameworks. On the  other hand, the dimensionality and solidity of the words comes to symbolize  &ldquo;reading.&rdquo; Immersion in this environment is reading.<br>
            None of this  is true. It is not that spatial poetry is not aesthetically impressive. Murray  is correct in this, but the effects and the symbolics of reading are at best a  kind of hallucination of immersion. Immersion is the condition for spatiality and  the encyclopedic, not the other way round. The poetics of immersion are not  found in the thematization of inscription and the production of a discourse of  readable space. The poetics of immersion are in the heuristic playing out of  bodies placed in an imaginary that is not reduced to but rupturing symbolic  frameworks of inscription. The poem is what de-scribes inscription to the real.<br>
            First-person  gaming environments do not create immersion in the way Murray describes. <a href="http://half-life.com/">Half-Life</a> is a model: the basic experience is  often of being in the dark or haze, or up against unknown materials, or cast  into water, blood, oil, sand, and plasma. Far from the given-ness and  familiarity of a three-dimensional spatial expanse -- comfortably simulated to  be like our world here, but unlike enough to confirm the difference &ndash; far from  this, in Half-Life there is confusion, terror, speed, and fuzziness. Spatiality  is always an after-construct, an imaginary mapping constantly built from the given-ness  of immersion. The game does not create immersion through spatiality and  encyclopedic information; the game begins from the phenomenological problematic  of immersion, and the resulting narrative is a mapping and displacement of this  problematic. As a &ldquo;problematic,&rdquo; we must acknowledge that immersion <em>is</em>, but it offers no origin or teleology. The frantic  violence and desperate repetitions of the game are attempts to control this  initial situation. We need to stop discussing immersion as if it were a result  or payoff, as if it were something that needed to be created or brought about.  I am not simply arguing for a different definition or emphasis. For Murray,  immersion is a kind of hallucinatory effect created by carefully manipulating  symbols and structures. For such a viewpoint, the problematic of immersion in  its viscerality and sentience can be thematized and reflected upon, or it can  be theorized in its absence, but it remains inaccessible. The result is a  regulatory institutional aesthetics: techniques for bringing about the effect  of immersion; a discourse for valuing the products of computer spaces as  products; and a symbolic suturing of the relation between bodies and the  computer spaces. (The name of this discursive formation is &ldquo;new media.&rdquo;) By  contrast, I say we are always already immersed in viscerality and sentience.<br>
&ldquo;New Word  Order&rdquo; [NWO] is a mod for the computer game Half-Life, one of several I made  under the title &ldquo;Black Mesa Poems,&rdquo; with the goal of exploring immersive  phenomenologies of gaming. NWO is a playable map but not a total modification.  Whereas a total mod re-codes the game engine to alter the physics and &ldquo;world&rdquo;  of the game, the map creates a new space within the existing game world. The  &ldquo;Black Mesa Poems&rdquo; are about the limit phenomenologies of the Half-Life world  and do not alter the existing game. My choice of Half-Life was not accidental.  Gaming is the single largest demographic of new media usage. Half-Life stands  out among other games for its combination of first-person shooter action and a  coherent and compelling story sustained over many hours of gameplay. <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=game&AppId=240">Counter-Strike</a>,  a Half-Life mod, is far and away the most popular of all online multiplayer  games. It is no exaggeration to say that the world of Half-Life is the world of  first-person gaming.<br>
I made the  &ldquo;Black Mesa Poems&rdquo; using standard wares for creating Half-Life maps. The tools  are hard to configure initially, but easy to use. (My mother learned how to  make a map in about fifteen minutes.) A map is simply a playable space, and may  be as small as a room or much larger. The maps require the Half-Life engine to  play, but it is easy enough to record and output a video of the gameplay. When  you first enter the NWO map, the game&rsquo;s first-person viewpoint shows you a  large space with words hanging in the air. The words are thin but physical  objects. You can jump and climb on them, you can run along the tops, you can go  behind and see the reverse of the letters. You soon find the weapons scattered  around the room: a crowbar, a rifle, and hand grenades. You can keep playing  and wandering in the space, of course, but you soon begin to attack the words. It  cannot be helped. The attack is a part of the immersive conditions of the  space. The crowbar will destroy individual letters; the rifle or grenades will  take out whole words or more. Soon the words are broken and reduced. The  fragments continue to hang in the air. You can use this as a reduced text, a  processed writing for alternative readings. As the hanging letters swirl with  smoke and become more and more isolated, the text thins to unreadability.  Nothing is left in the end. Break the words, destroy the letters, and the room  is empty. You can pace around but no words are left. If you still have a  grenade, you can complete the destruction and drop it at your feet to end the  game. Otherwise, the space is yours, cleansed of words.<br>
            My goal was  this experience of emptying out of words to leave nothing but the situation,  the space of the game. The whole piece, from the beginning of the mod to this  conclusion of the empty space, is about the imaginary situation of bodies in  the real. To continue thinking on immersion and the implications of this empty  situation in NWO, I will discuss the <a href="http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=POTD.Detail&id=457">Nihilanth</a>.  Its lair is at the end of Half-Life, an enormous cavern inhabited by a giant creature  resembling a brain with an atrophied body, or else possibly resembling a giant  foetus with a swollen brain, and with large claws and malevolent but empty  stare. You must battle and kill the Nihilanth. The moment you approach it, the  creature begins shooting its deadly colored energy balls. You must dodge these,  destroy its supply of replenishing crystals, and shoot it in the head  repeatedly until its skull peels back like a lemon and exposes the brain  underneath.<br>
            In the game&rsquo;s  narrative, a misguided scientific experiment at the secret Black Mesa  government research facility opens dimensional rifts or seams. Alien creatures  from another world arrive through these rips. Not only are the rips portals or  gateways to our world, but they fundamentally rip the world, altering culture,  physiology and physics, bringing changes to the environment and turning humans  into alien zombie slaves. As a result, this is a game about defeating the  aliens and restoring the world, restoring the proper dimensions of reality, as  well as defeating government troops and agents intent on covering up or  benefiting from the dimensional rift. As the game progresses, you must enter  the alien dimension, the dimension that rips bodies and the physical world. The  Nihilanth is the supreme alien intelligence, the controlling being holding open  the dimensional rift. The bloated body sac of the Nihilanth <em>is</em> rupture of dimensions, destruction of worlds, and  maceration of bodies.<br>
            Dimensions  split. People become alien. Headcrabs transform other people, your colleagues,  into walking zombies. Same becomes other and different. All that is other must  die. The world of Half-Life is simple: there are immobile structures things  such as rocks and walls; there are moveable structures such as boxes and  tables; and there are living creatures. As otherness invades, even the rocks  and walls become alien, tables turn organic. Half-Life is a shooter game and  the story advances through annihilation of the enemy. As life is ruptured by  the alien, all that lives must be killed. Matter moves because of the dimensional  split; matter is shootable; all matter must be shot. The alien other that  inhabits the living must be destroyed. When you shoot something it breaks into  pieces, particles of rock or flesh or alien goo. These pieces slowly fade into  nothing. You must destroy all matter, destroy all that moves. Soon there will  be nothing but space. As the game progresses, you hone your instincts and  reflexes, learning to see otherness everywhere, in every object, in everything  that moves. You shoot to kill. In the Nihilanth&rsquo;s lair you are face to face  with this otherness. You face the other that inhabits the same. Its face is odd  and empty, its features sockets of darkness.<br>
            All that you  see in Half-Life is through your eyes. Your first-person view exactly coincides  with your &ldquo;character&rdquo; Gordon Freeman. Since there are no &ldquo;cut-scenes,&rdquo; no  videos where you forego your control of the character to the game, your actions  are effectively your own, your view is effectively that of your consciousness.  What the character gives is the context and the tools of the world, but not the  interactions. In effect, this is a drama of consciousness, a playing out of  your viewpoint against the otherness of the Nihilanth. To destroy the alien and  win the game is the triumph of consciousness, the accomplishment of a  perceiving &ldquo;I&rdquo; that takes over and makes over the world. <br>
            Throughout  your time in Xen, the alien dimension, you hear a mysterious voice speaking  fragments and phrases. The voice is separate from the gameplay and seems to  float in your mind. It is a kind of inner voice, a telepathy or thought  insertion directly into your brain. Since the gameplay up until that point  allows you total control of your interactions, with no intrusion or takeover,  this voice is felt as a disturbance, a schizoid splitting, an invasion of the  self-sameness of your consciousness and your first-person view. It whispers  things like: &ldquo;Alone, not you...  alone, not you... alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Now die...now die...now...&rdquo; or &ldquo;The truth...you  can never know...the truth...&rdquo; In the final scene, you learn the truth: this  voice is the Nihilanth muttering in your head. As you move in to attack, the  voice increase in volume. Its source is clear. You face the split within  consciousness. You battle for your self. Defeating the Nihilanth silences the  voices, closes over the split in consciousness. All the objects of this world  are gone but you.<br>
            Facing the Nihilanth  means successfully negotiating with the narratology and computer coding of  Half-Life. The Nihilanth is a &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; In computer games, you typically must  defeat a boss to complete a major segment or level of a game. In an arcade  game, speed and difficulty typically increase as play goes on. Eventually, no  one can continue playing and &ldquo;high scores&rdquo; indicate records or thresholds of  attempt to keep up with the computer. By contrast, a boss represents narrative  segmentation. The end of an episode and the beginning of a new one requires  effort and presents challenges to overcome. These are all condensed into the  boss, typically in the form of an opposing character or creature, but possibly  some other physical obstacle, requiring repeated attempts, complex actions, and  many lives. The Nihilanth is that special category, the &ldquo;final boss.&rdquo; To face  the Nihilanth, you must have successfully faced the various sub-bosses  representing other narrative segments of the game. Destroying the Nihilanth&rsquo;s  brain means completing the game and preventing the invasion of earth by the Xen  aliens, at least until <a href="http://half-life2.com/">Half-Life 2</a>. The  Nihilanth, a truly difficult monster to kill, is the terminal point of the  game, the end of the narrative and of the first-person shooter action.<br>
            In terms of  the Half-Life game engine and the tools used by the game designers and modders  alike, items in the world are chunks of code known as &ldquo;entities.&rdquo; Entities  include things like couches and rocks, as well as aliens and humans. The entity  monster class covers all living things, from humans to <a href="http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=POTD.Detail&id=457">Nihilanths</a> (the monster_nihilanth entity). All monster entities share preset spatial  relations or triggers that determine actions and responses within the game. The  condition of triggers determine whether a monster attacks or not and under what  circumstances. Other chunks of code such as multi-managers can direct complex  and coordination actions such as the battle with the Nihilanth. The spatial  relation to the Nihilanth and the unfolding narrative space of the game is tied  to these snippets of code and the target flags they contain. The Nihilanth  attacks because of these settings in its code. You attack because you choose  to, although your movement and actions are conditioned by your own coding. Each  moment in the attack is the execution and playing out of the limitations and  settings within chunks of code.<br>
            The moment  that interests me is when you arrive at the Nihilanth&rsquo;s lair. You see the  Nihilanth and it sees you. If you step forward the attack begins, but  everything is in suspense until you move. The Nihilanth floats around, stares,  floats, you stare back. If this creature is pure other and must be killed, if  it is the other ripping apart reality, splitting humanness, threatening the  cohesiveness of my consciousness, and if this is a narrative structure where  only killing all in your path will lead to the conclusion, then what occurs in  this suspension? What other is this that does not attack, that looks like a  giant floating foetus with claws, which observes and holds your gaze? For me  the question addresses the phenomenology of the game world, and cannot be  cleanly separated from immersive structures we inhabit in daily life. What  happens when I face others? What happens is that I disclose myself, disclose my  body and begin the coded encounters we call culture, but is that all? Must I  encounter the other at all? What is an encounter here?<br>
            The moment  that interests me could be seen as &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; gameplay, in the sense of an  unplanned and unexpected use of the game. The result is not a new behavior,  however, in the sense of &ldquo;game currency trading&rdquo; and other complex emergent  gaming. It is closer to a glitch like the famous &ldquo;M&rdquo; Pok&eacute;mon glitch that introduces an alternative  being from within the game&rsquo;s coding. Yet the encounter with a Nihilanth  involves no mistake in the code but a splitting of phenomenological  domains already at work within the game.<br>
            One step  forward and enter the zone of path marks and trigger conditions set in the  Nihilanth&rsquo;s code. The attack will begin. Of course, I can choose not to fight,  but the Nihilanth&rsquo;s energy bolts will destroy me in an instant. In other words,  the code executed at that moment and in that step is inexorable and can only  means death, of the other or of the same. Game over. For as long as you wait,  however, you share this space with the Nihilanth. I want to say that this  moment is uncoded, a pure immersion in the space of the game. Of course, by  definition this moment is encoded. Nothing is added by pointing out that  everything in this environment is code, is executable and programmed codes. Yet  in this moment, facing the Nihilanth, the code that determines that final boss  and the code that I am are not yet in play, not yet executed, or at least only  playing and executing in the inhabitation of this space that is not yet a  battlefield. I share the space with the other, however briefly. The Nihilanth  and I are located in a shared space. In this sharing, the dimensional split in  reality and the schizoid split in my mind are my being and not obstacles to  overcome. I am these fissures and share them with the other. This inhabitation  is the condition of language and action. Moving forward, I advance the  narrative, I perform or execute that narrative code. Engaging the Nihilanth in  battle means accepting the address of the narrative and the coding that we are,  the Nihilanth and me. The battle is the condition of language. This is the case  for every action in every first-person game: to move or to act is to address  and be addressed, movement is discourse production.<br>
            But holding  here, circling, looking at each other, we are locations and codes without  addresses. The shared space is a code space as continuous flow of the game  world. Coded otherness is not executed yet -- the otherness of culture, of  agendas, of narratives, of masculinist and Americanist and heroic destruction  and death &ndash; not an encounter but facing the other, a giant brain with an  atrophied body or a giant foetus with a swollen brain, muttering &ldquo;Deceive you... will deceive you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alone, not  you... alone, not you... alone.&rdquo;<br>
            Again, the  phenomenology of the game world cannot be cleanly separated from immersive  structures we inhabit in daily life. I cannot separate my expression to the  Nihilanth &ndash; in the gaming narrative of a final encounter with otherness that  must be destroyed to protect culture and the self &mdash; from any other expression  of myself. To the contrary: we must recognize and question the specialized  agenda that sees immersion as a symbolic effect rather than a real part of  everyday domains. Every encounter includes this expression to the other. The  Nihilanth is my other.<br>
            In NWO, the  text is difficult to read, scattered throughout the space. The text in NWO is  composed of phrases from &ldquo;Introduction to Poetry,&rdquo; a short poem from former US  Poet Laureate Billy Collins&rsquo; 1988 collection <em>The Apple that Astonished Paris</em> (Collins, 1988). The poem is about teaching students  to read a poem. Collins asks students to &ldquo;walk inside the poem&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; He uses  a range of images of images to suggest what he wants the students to learn from  the poem. The students fail the scene of instruction: rather than waterskiing  &ldquo;across the surface of a poem / waving at the author&rsquo;s name on the shore,&rdquo; they  &ldquo;begin beating it with a hose / to find out what it really means.&rdquo; For Collins,  the students want the poem to mean rather than be. What are the conditions for  a poem to <em>be</em> in this way, as room  or hive or illuminated slide, as Collins wants? The violence in Collins&rsquo; poem  registered for me while I made NWO in early 2003, during the second invasion of  Iraq. I read Collins describing how the students read the poem, tying it to a  chair and torturing it. Collins wished for a better educated reading, a more  proper reading, and one that would know how to immerse itself in poetry and to  arrive at the correct and pleasing symbolic fulfillment of the words. The  institutional habitus Collins wanted to teach was a demand for immersion in a  hallucinatory knowledge that provides the right way to read, and a proper  parceling out of beings in the world. This institution is a philosophy of  distance, of thematics of concern without engagement. More is at work here. Collins  is disappointed that the students cannot rise to these conditions, and I  sympathize with the challenges of the hermeneutic methods, but I also read  their actions as a kind of refusal of inscription within the institution of  literature. Their violence resists the knowledge offered by the professor,  resists the capitalization represented by the poem as room or hive or illuminated  slide. Violence shorts both the desire to know and the institution of  interpretation. The smooth, closed Being of the poem, the hermetic hermeneutic  sought by Collins, is ruptured and fissured by other beings, by the mutter of  other voices. My point is that the poem is as much about relations to otherness  as poetics, as it is about the importance of literary aesthetics.<br>
            In the end,  this scene of torture is the literal reality of the poem. For me, &ldquo;Introduction  to poetry&rdquo; linked to the circulation and re-circulation of tortured-bodies and  interpretive agendas. Every game and every image is part of this linkage. The  destruction within NWO reveals the linkage, discloses the settings of bodies in  space. Computer space is not simulation but communication. I ask: what poem remains  if we destroy both the response taught by the institution of literature and the  propriety of how we read and respond to images? NWO is not an alternative  between the cultural capital of the literary institution, on the one hand, and  a dumb literalism on the other. Rather, NWO is corrosion: corrosion as working  through, as play; corrosion of poems and phrases and words down to their  settings; corrosion as wearing away of the symbolic and the frameworks of  inscription; corrosion down to the settings of bodies in the real.</span></p>

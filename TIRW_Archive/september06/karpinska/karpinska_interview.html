          <span class="style6">By Rita Raley</span>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>How would you characterize your current  work in three dimensional text and/or spatial poetry?</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>AK: </strong>This interview  comes at an interesting time, when I am having serious doubts about pursuing  spatial poetry, at least in the way I have approached it in the past. For one  thing, a screen is a screen. It&rsquo;s not space. The computer screen is a powerful  interface, but I believe we are conforming to its demands as users, and not the  other way around. I&rsquo;m looking forward to exploring technology in physical  spaces, where people are out and about living their lives. One technology that  comes to mind is the mobile phone, which has already surpassed the computer as  the digital device of choice for much of the world. Our spatial knowledge  comes, of course, from physical space. Now we are out in space with a  mini-computer in our pockets. But back to your questions&hellip;</p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>This is a general question, but would  you be willing to speculate about the significance of the word or letter&rsquo;s  becoming three-dimensional? About what difference it might make for poetry,  current paradigms of reading, our understanding of text?&nbsp; What do you find yourself able to  achieve that was not possible with previous reading and writing technologies?</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>AK: </strong>With digital  screen-based text, one thing that still intrigues me is overlapping. With mar  puro and most of my other 3D poems, motion and interaction combine different  parts of the text. You can create spontaneous relationships among the words,  both as the author and as the reader. I could perhaps achieve a similar effect  by printing on transparent sheets and instructing readers on how to move the  sheets around, but that is cumbersome. The experience of the digital version is  smoother.</p>
          <p class="style5">As for an effect on current paradigms of reading&hellip; this is an  important question. How are we going to engage younger audiences that grew up  with video games and texting and surfing the Web? With a recent piece of mine, <em><a href="http://technekai.com/nobodyknows">nobody knows but you</a></em>, I wanted to answer that question by creating a space  for readers to perform the text. I essentially placed text on the same level as  image, and the reader can manipulate the size and position of each, like a VJ  (video jockey). This is certainly not something I intend a reader to curl up  with in bed &ndash; it&rsquo;s designed for a club environment or similar social space.  Mashing together multimedia and text can make the experience of reading more  playful. In John R. Kelly&rsquo;s concept of play, he emphasizes how we go about it,  not just what we do. This is where interactivity comes in, the &ldquo;how.&rdquo;</p>        </td>

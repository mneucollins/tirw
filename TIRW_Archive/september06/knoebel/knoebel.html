          <span class="style6">By Rita Raley</span>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR: How would you  characterize your current work in three dimensional text and/or spatial poetry?</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>DK:</strong> I tinker with  words in space. I like the cantankerous Rube Goldberg&nbsp; feeling that Auden caught in his notion of the poem as a  &quot;verbal&nbsp; contraption&quot;;  Williams's &quot;machine made of words&quot; seems bland by&nbsp; comparison, more Ford Fairlane than  Stanley Steamer.</p>
          <p class="style5">I'm just getting back to Click Poetry after completing  several&nbsp; screenplays. I realized  that I don't have the temperament to see a&nbsp; script through production. For one thing, there's just too  much&nbsp; teamwork required. However,  the experience taught me how to stick with one project for an extended period  of time. When I was first working on <a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/">Click  Poetry</a>, I couldn&rsquo;t stay with a piece more than a few weeks. Commitment  anxiety. </p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR: What is the  significance of the word or letter&rsquo;s becoming three-dimensional? Can you  comment on what difference it might make for poetry, current paradigms of  reading, our understanding of text, etc.?</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>DK: </strong>I don&rsquo;t know. I  used three dimensional letters in my early VRML work and never answered those  questions to my own satisfaction. I realized that I was not interested in the  thickness of letters, but in the interplay of words and space. So I went to  flat letters in three-dimensional space.</p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR:&nbsp; This is interesting because the individual works in  Click Poetry are quite dense, semiotically, conceptually, and formally. One  gets the sense that each piece required a tremendous commitment in itself.</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>DK:&nbsp; </strong>Most of them develop in my mind over a long period  of time and I keep sketchbooks of ideas. But once I decide to work on  something, the work goes fairly fast. I code mostly by hand, and I make (lots  of) mistakes. Those, too, may be sources of inspiration.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR: What do you find  yourself able to achieve that was not possible with previous reading and  writing technologies?</strong></p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>DK:&nbsp; </strong>I like to put words in new spatial relationships.  Can I surprise&nbsp; myself by playing  with their positions and orientations? By animating&nbsp; phrases through xyz coordinates? Can I enhance, open up,  deepen or&nbsp; charge the words in ways  that aren't possible when they're confined to the page? See also David Smith, <a href="http://www.davidsmithestate.org/bio_files/the_letter.html">The Letter</a> (1950). </p>
          <p class="style5"><strong>RR: Do you find  yourself thinking about different reading practices as well? I tend to think  that there are conventional modes of signification at place in <a href="http://home.ptd.net/~clkpoet/">Click Poetry</a> but also new  configurations of text, not only swarming, broken, and/or illegible words but  also reading along the z axis. What I find compelling about Click Poetry and  some of the cube-based works that will be featured in TIRW is that they do  challenge the top-centric and left-centric biases of screen- and page-based  reading. </strong></p>
          <span class="style5"><strong>DK: </strong>&nbsp;&quot;Heart Pole&quot; highlights other kinds of reading as the viewer maneuvers the text into readable positions. A readable position may be upside-down and/or backwards; at the top  of the screen, at the bottom; in front of, or behind, the other elements </span>

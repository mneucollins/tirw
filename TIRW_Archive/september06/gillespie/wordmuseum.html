<p align="left" class="style3"><b>Word Museum</b> was written by William Gillespie, programmed
  by Jason Rodriguez and David Dao at the Brown University CAVE.</p>
<p align="left" class="sb_text"><img src="../images/lhs-large.jpg" width="432" height="288"></p>
<p align="left" class="style5">As the second person to be offered
            Brown University's exclusive electronic writing fellowship, I entered
            a nascent degree program in which the only course offering was Cavewriting.
            The assignment I gave myself, in creating an ostensibly literary
  digital art installation in a virtual reality environment, was simply to create
  something legible. I had quickly discovered that the potential of the CAVE
  to make virtual objects scalable and manipulable in three-dimensional
            space was precisely the potential to render a text unreadable. Because
            a word that is enormous or minute, turned upside down, or read from
            the side or behind, becomes what a designer might
  call &quot;text
as decoration.&quot;</p>
<p align="left" class="style5"> Because the means of moving through the virtual space or manipulating
  objects using the wand tended to be clunky and awkward -- much more effortful
  than manipulating
            a book, because only the programmers are allowed in the CAVE
  for an extended stay, because the programming is tedious (and the programmers
  assigned to me were inexperienced), and because an hour of wearing
            the goggles would induce strain in all but the most resilient of
  digital
            art lovers, I could rule out any book-length text. More disappointingly,
            it was not clear how even a substantial paragraph could be presented.
            Noah Wardrip-Fruin, of course, solved this problem in the simplest
            possible fashion&#8212;by ignoring the illusion of virtual space,
            projecting static paragraphs on the walls, and giving the reader
            a chance to
            read them,
            before employing the capacity of the CAVE to 
            render
            them
            spectacularly
illegible. But I did not want to rewrite his project. </p>
<p align="left" class="style5"> What resulted was the Word Museum.</p>
<p align="left" class="style5"> Consider the letter O. You can rotate it on the plane of the
  page, or even look at it from behind, and it is still readable as an O.
            The letter X is similar, if less versatile: it can be rotated to
  any of four positions and read from in front or from behind. The letter M is
  horizontally symmetric -- it can be flipped horizontally (read from behind,
  as if viewed in
  a mirror) -- and is still the letter M. Similarly, the letter K is vertically
  symmetric-you can flip it vertically
            (as if viewing its reflection in the surface of a pond) and it is
still readable as a K, even if the proportions may be slightly askew. (Assume
that I am using a simple sans-serif typeface such as Futura).</p>
<p align="left" class="style5"> In this manner, I created a number of word objects that could
be viewed from different angles without becoming illegible. The reader moves
  through a vast white architecture, through several apparently aircraft-hanger
  sized rooms, including a room with a scultped pond, confronting textual sculptures
  and paintings, some static, most kinetic.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/iAvow3-large.jpg" width="432" height="288"> </p>
<p align="left" class="style5"><b>I AVOW A MYTH YOU HOAX</b> is a horizontally-symmetric
text, rotating horizontally. In one instantiation, the words are
  distributed throughout a room. In another variation (below), the text is set
  in a column.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/screenavow5.jpg" width="400" height="333"></p>
<p align="left" class="style5">In the background are <b>SOS</b> and <b>pod</b>,
    rotating
  two-dimensional poems framed as paintings.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/screenbanpot.jpg" width="400" height="299"></p>
<p align="left"> <span class="style5"><b>BAN POT</b> is a cluster of nine alphabet blocks. Each side
  presents a three letter word. Using the wand, the reader can zap the blocks,
  making
  them disappear, revealing the letter on the block behind. Every
  possible
  configuration
              is a three-letter English word.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/bodice.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p align="left"> <span class="style5"><b>...BODICE-BEDECKED OHIO BIKE CHICK...</b> is a rotating kinetic
  poem composed of vertically-symmetric letters. The poem rotates along a horizontal
  axis, and when it is upside-down the lines are the same but in the opposite
  order. By alternating subjects and prepositions, I managed to make either configuration
  vaguely grammatic.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/screencube.jpg" width="400" height="325"></p>
<p align="left" class="style5"><b><a href="../../tirweb/feature/sept/lettertolinus/index.html">LETTER TO LINUS </a></b> is a &quot;hypercube&quot; (a hypertext in the shape
  of a cube), a combinatoric multisequential revolutionary poem. The reader is
  not
  meant to read the faces of the cube, but across the edges. Each face has the
  beginning (eg. &quot;Take&quot;) and end (&quot;down resistance&quot;) of a phrase, with the six
  beginnings and six endings resulting in 24 different slogans. The hypercube
  as recreated
  in the Word Museum is incomplete: the slogans are really meant to be transitions
  between six paragraphs which can be read in any order, and which describe an
  alarming future. I found no way to fit the paragraphs into the cube while
  adhering to the overall
  constraint
  that
  everything be always legible. However, the full text was published online in
  a previous issue of the <i>Iowa Review Web</i> and the curious may read it
  in its entirety.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/screenwow.jpg" width="400" height="325"></p>
<p align="left" class="style5"><b>WOW MOM</b> is the simplest and most elegant demonstration of the
  Word Museum's constraints: horizontally- and vertically-symmetric, the poem
  is legible from any angle (except when viewed from the plane of the text itself).
  In this variation the poem hovers above a pedestal, rotating on two axes.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/id.jpg" width="400" height="267"> </p>
<p align="left" class="style5">The vertically-symmetric word <b>ID</b> rotates along a horizontal
  axis that runs along the floor. The word emerges from below and is submerges
  again, representing the subconscious. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/screenmothtom.jpg" width="400" height="330" border="0"></p>
<p align="left"> <span class="style5"><b>MOTH TOM / I MIX A MAXIM</b> is a horizontally-symmetric
  palindrome set as a rotating halo. In other words, the sequence
  of letters is the same forward and backward, and the text can be read from
  in front or from behind.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="../images/daveincave400.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p align="left" class="style5"> Here is programmer David Dao proofreading our virtual signature:
  the rotating initials <b>DD</b> (vertically-symmetric) and <b>WM</b> (legible
  when rotated 180 degrees in the plane of the text).</p>

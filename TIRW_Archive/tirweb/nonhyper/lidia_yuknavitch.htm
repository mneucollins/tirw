            <BR>
                  <P>1. The Alchemy of the Melting Pot<BR>
      </P>

      <P>In my car. My red, Toyota Corolla. Exhaust hums in front of
      me, behind me. Little voices scratch out of giant boxes with
      writing on them. Money is readied in the hands of drivers. The
      sun dips down into her wallow; evening descends on a line of
      cars in the drive-through at McDonalds.</P>

      <P>A tiny little man in the distance. I can see him in my rearview,
      just above the words, &quot;objects in mirror are closer than
      they appear.&quot; He is on the move, window to window, car to
      car. In the rearview I can see the faces of other drivers pinch-up
      as he nears their cars. They dread him. Already they are cringing,
      scrunching up their shoulders, locking their doors, working buttonholes
      with their asses in the vinyl seats, trying desperately to look
      at something else. Anything but the approaching man, bearded,
      hair in an argument with itself, slightly dirty, rumpled and
      clearly week-worn clothes, white. He is a white male, maybe 35,
      maybe 45.</P>

      <P>By the time you get to the black young man in the first window,
      huge waves of relief send a shiver up your back. You've made
      it to the first window, godammit, and there is an angel there
      to take your money. There is no room, in other words, for the
      nasty white man begging money to come around to your window driver
      side of the car, he simply can't fit between the ledge of the
      window with the angel taking your money and the safety of your
      car, its window down, your finger on the button to electronically
      raise it should danger appear. The young black man takes your
      money and returns your change, asks you what kind of sauce you
      want, gives it to you in a little and beautiful brown bag with
      golden arches on it, why, it's heaven, it's just like being in
      heaven, the delight is filling your whole body now, earlier you
      thought you had to pee and the line of cars seemed unbearable,
      but now, now you are making an exchange that is simple and good
      and profound in its truth. The young black man smiles and waves
      as you head slowly to the second window, his cap is clean, his
      teeth are big and white, his salary doesn't even enter your mind,
      you are free, you are on the way to the second window.</P>

      <P>Surely he is at one of the cars behind you. Surely things
      will get held up there, someone will refuse to open their window
      and he will knock on it, or he will appear inside the frame of
      the front windshield and the driver will divert their gaze, he
      will give up and move on, or back, or away. You risk a quick
      look in your rearview---nothing nothing nothing like pennies
      from heaven.</P>

      <P>Your car almost magically glides along to the second window,
      its opening apparent, hands visible, a bag of food bulging and
      white and smelling of good oil---all vegetable oil---and fried
      things. Your family is waiting. Your car is filled with gas.
      The money has been paid. A pimply-faced girl with headgear and
      braces hands you your bag, but you see capitalism and youth emerging
      from the window, you see her first summer job, her first lessons
      at responsibility and a savings account and taking care of herself,
      you see her on her way to college, yes, that's it, the summer
      before college, the lessons she is learning, what a good student
      she will make, how she will excel in school, how she will learn
      well, how she will enter the workforce with a good head on her
      shoulders. And then there is a rapping at your window on the
      passenger's side, and strange how you forgot, isn't it? And your
      head swivels over out of dumb instinct, and there he is, his
      bad teeth and leathery skin and marble-blurred eyes filling the
      window, like a close-up, magnified, terrifying. His horrible
      mouth is opening and closing, he is saying something to you,
      he is talking to you, his muffled voice breaking through the
      glass shelter, now he is yelling, you are clutching your bag
      for dear life, you are putting your car in drive, his fingers
      at the ledge of your world, your own body like a snake's: all
      spine and nerve.</P>

      <P>Then a new image; from the front window you see a man in uniform,
      my god, a Korean man with a McDonald's uniform complete with
      cap and manager's badge is running toward your car, he is waving
      his arms, he is shouting. With one hand you are clutching your
      steering wheel as in a near- miss accident and with the other
      hand you are clutching your white McDonald's bag heavy and full
      and your eyes are like a dear in the headlights and your body
      is taught and your nipples are hard as little stones. Your mouth
      is dry and you are as alert as you are capable of being. The
      Korean manager yells at the shitty little begging white man,
      you go now. You go now. You outta here, now. Shithead. Motherfucking.
      You go. No slaving here. The slip doesn't even phase you. You
      are with him. United. You are grateful. There is no dividing
      you. The two of you are in it together, you are saving one another,
      you are making the world a better place, you are the American
      way embodied, you are at each other's backs, you are one hundred
      million served.

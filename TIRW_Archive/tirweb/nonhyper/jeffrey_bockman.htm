<td valign="top" align="top" colspan="2" nowrap rowspan="15" width="324" class="bodytext1">A FABLE OF WORDS<br>
            <br>
            
<p>I have come here from across that great sea
            of words, whose spumy surface is a history
            of all our travels.<br>
            <br>
            Why have I come? <br>
            <br>
            Across those seas I sat and watched from
            my window, back there in a land now lost,
            while on those streets, cobbled, where a
            score of nations and a hundred generations
            had freely peddled their wares---newly minted
            expressives, qualifiers, actions and exotic
            abstractions; while on those very streets
            where I had first traded in simple phrases
            of common usage and then slowly acquired
            the gift of transformation, spinning chapters
            and verse as a spider her silken web; while
            on those streets, those same streets that
            saw the appearance of the twenty-six, and
            then twenty-ninth, and finally the thirty-seventh
            letter; while on those same streets the Removers
            came and I watched, for days, unmoving, the
            entrance latched thrice and a beloved bookshelf
            toppled against the frame of the door, as
            they arrived, three-by-three, their opalescent
            banners artificially rigid in the windless
            air --- I, who had mastered the One-Thousand
            Metaphors, who had been awarded the Spectral
            Ring of the Second Adam, watched for days
            on end and did nothing.</p>
<p>I recall how when the Removers first arrived,
            the people imagined the old prophesies to
            have come true, and tossed paper wreaths
            before the marchers, in expectation of Single
            Point Time, and the <i>infinite in a word,</i> as the first Tellers had written. I can
            still see before me, in memories clearer
            than I would have them be, how at first the
            Removers, their uniforms trimmed in white
            quills, gave all the signs, fulfilled the
            prescribed order of symbols, metamorphosed
            old, graying words, long shaded into meaninglessness,
            into pure and guilded denoters---and the
            people, so long befuddled by connotations
            more numerous than the twilight stars, rejoiced
            at the sharpness of these words, bereft of
            the nuance and ambiguity that had, so they,
            so we all, believed, crippled our progress.</p>
<p>And so the Removers, three-by-three through
            the cheer-lined streets, marched with the
            impunity of the wizened lexicographers, even,
            for some, with the presumptive grace of the
            original Tellers. And when the speed of our
            days increased, unfettered by secondary meanings
            and codicils and connotations, no one spoke
            up as the old myths, the poems of our most
            elemental joys and sorrows, were slowly stripped
            of power, words replaced or suppressed, whole
            lines even. And when the Removers revoked
            the thirty-seventh letter, and then more
            and more, until only the base ten letters
            remained, most everyone merely shrugged,
            and accepted the now almost telegraphic mode
            of writing and speech as the logical, and
            even the theological, next step in our evolution.</p>
<p>Of course, there were a few who did disbelieve,
            a few who saw those that understood the ultimate<i> infinite in a word</i> to be literally true as deluded. But by
            then it was too late. Those of us who had
            remained too long in our rooms, ensconced
            within our old books, throwing up innocuous
            shields of words bearing all the old letters,
            could only fail, and failing, were faced
            with either obeisance to the Removers, or
            flight.</p>
<p>And yet, here I am, across that great spumy
            sea, crafting my gray phrases, attempting
            to account, to tally, to, finally, do just
            battle against the sharp, delineated world
            of diminished words I have fled. I am not
            confident in the rightness of my choices,
            but these nuanced words are all I have left,
            and should I, too, be left, at the end, failed,
            neglected, a tattered emblem of a spectral
            land, panhandling for letters, do not jeer
            at me....</p>

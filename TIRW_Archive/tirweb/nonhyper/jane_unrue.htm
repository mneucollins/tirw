            <TD valign="top" align="top" colspan="2" nowrap rowspan="15" width="324" class="bodytext1">CHILD, BIRD, BOX
            <P>A portion that has been obliterated contained
            the middle section of the figure of a child
            (there was an inscription in the margins
            to the right and left of the figure, this
            inscription having been obliterated), and
            if we were to reach around, we would discover,
            on the other side near the base, the figure
            of the child again, the limbs of which are
            there, the middle section is there, although
            the head, we would know by feel, has been
            obliterated. The small panel next up below
            the cross-beam on this side contains another
            figure of the child, head obliterated, and
            still proceeding upward, we see in the next
            panel a figure of the child, much smaller
            than in any of the other panels that we will
            have encountered, although in perfect proportion,
            this figure of the child smaller being, as
            in the previous panel, only partially draped,
            head again obliterated; whereas reaching
            around again and sliding down a little, we
            discover yet another figure of the child,
            rendered all but naked here (there is an
            additional figure just above the child's
            left arm of a bird supporting itself by a
            claw grasped firmly to a bough ending with
            a tuft of foliage, its other claw tucked
            beneath its wing), the ankles of the child
            we would recognize as having been obliterated.
            The head is obliterated. The feet, further
            down, are there, they're in shoes, and as
            long as we are proceeding in this way, at
            the upper edge (the top stone, incidentally,
            was taken long ago) is the largest of all
            of the panels. The head has flowing hair
            that extends to the shoulders, inscription
            filling the margins to the left and right
            of this topmost figure of the child on this
            side, naked, rendered perfectly, although
            in the hand of the child there is a box that,
            when compared to the claw, if we were to
            reach around to the tuft out at the end of
            the bough, is an absolute horror. It looks
            and feels like little better than a lump.
            And it is the faultiness of the execution
            of this box, combined with less skillful
            lettering and irregularities in the spacing
            of the inscription in the margins (a final
            C gets stuffed into the lower half of an
            A), along with, reaching perhaps just one
            last time, the figure of the head-again-obliterated
            child herself, fully draped and not feeling
            anything like what we have come to expect---she's
            not much more than ripples against your hand---that
            forces us to wonder whether someone might
            have been compelled to hurry, shoes and hands
            tucked under, her little neck draped over
            as well; or whether somewhere, maybe in a
            dream about looking far ahead at sticks laid
            down in piles along the endless shoreline,
            it had been arrived at that lettering and
            spacing in this panel should be presented
            with no great skill or regularity, and that
            the figure, on this occasion, be presented
            almost entirely covered up.</P>

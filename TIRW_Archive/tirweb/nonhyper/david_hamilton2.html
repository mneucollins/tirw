            <BR>
              <!--BODY TEXT BEGIN--><font color="#00CCFF">Mark Strand's poems 
              and translations have influenced many a younger writer. One poet 
              wrote me---this was several years ago---that he had just spent several 
              afternoons in the Library of the United States Information Service 
              in Nairobi, Kenya immersed in Strand's Selected Poems. One result 
              was that he wound up at the Writers' Workshop a few years later 
              and now has a small volume out of his own. Strand has a remarkable 
              way of coming through to writers in the making. He is, nevertheless, 
              something of an enigma, a &quot;difficult poet&quot; whom one reads 
              and rereads, seldom fully certain of what one has grasped. Here, 
              then, a clue. <BR>
              </font><BR>
            In Strand's most recent volume, <I>The Weather of Words</I> (Knopf 2000) a collection of miscellaneous
            prose, you will find him leading off with
            an ABC in which D is for Dante who, he says,
            has not influenced him. A cheeky thing to
            say, and not wholly accurate. How could any
            poet reasonably well read in the traditions
            of the West not be nudged by Dante, even
            if negatively, in the opposite direction?
            And Strand, like the rest of us of a certain
            age, most likely took a Great Books course
            or two. <BR>
            <BR>
            Dante is one of that handful of writers the
            West has been pleased to call, in our somewhat
            self-congratulatory way, &quot;universal.&quot;
            Toward the end of <I>Troilus and Criseyde,</I> Chaucer (c. 1385) made out an early list---Homer,
            Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, and Statius. We would
            probably substitute Dante and Shakespeare
            for Chaucer's last two. One thing they have
            in common, setting Ovid a little aside, is
            that they arrive at the universal through
            the extremely local and particular. To say
            Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Shakespeare is
            to say Troy, Rome, Florence, and London.
            Add Joyce and Proust and the pattern holds.<BR>
            <BR>
            Which is why we can agree that Dante did
            not influence Strand or, better, shoved him
            in the opposite direction, for rarely does
            a particular of time and place enter his
            picture. Strand's favorite image is the air
            filling in behind the person who divided
            space by walking through it, or sunlight
            streaming into the arc of a perfect dive
            as the diver vanishes, or a snowflake melting
            on the arm of a chair, leaving the air whole
            again---as if repaired. <BR>
            <BR>
            Rather than watching the ripples widen from
            a stone tossed in a pond, Strand notes how
            quickly the surface smooths out, as if it
            had not been disturbed, as if the being of
            which it reminds us were but a momentary
            blemish. Rather than regaling us with pleasant
            thoughts about the reach of our influence,
            he insists on &quot;a solemn waking / To
            brevity, to the lifting and falling away
            of attention.&quot; Local texture is as nothing
            compared to the immancence of eschatological
            transition and the great healing emptiness
            that will close around our small fissure
            in things. Isn't that a trip? <BR>
            <BR>
            So next time you pick up a volume of Strand's,
            look for another instance of his essential
            image. His speakers are never more than incidentally
            in Nova Scotia, Utah, Rio, or Iowa City.
            Think of them as Anyones pacing off their
            vanishing. <I>The Weather of Words,</I> by the way, has several other chapters equally
            sly. <!--END BODY TEXT--></TD>

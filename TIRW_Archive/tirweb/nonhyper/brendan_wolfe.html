            <BR>
            Too often, we Americans undergo experiences
            of a dizzying complexity only to dismiss
            them in language that is evasive and simplistic
            (Watergate becomes Monica-gate, Westward
            Expansion becomes Decision 2000). And Vietnam
            is hardly an exception: a mere three syllables
            referring not to a basket-shaped peninsula
            jutting into the South China Sea but to a
            momentarily exposed tip of the American subconscious,
            more or less neatly tucked away again when
            George Bush gleefully announced the end of
            the Vietnam Syndrome in 1991. In fact, as
            Pacific News Service commentator and Vietnamese-American
            Andrew Lam recently observed, the war was
            &quot;a difficult narrative that often gets
            reduced to two sides---America versus all
            Vietnamese.&quot; <BR>
            <BR>
            Which may suggest one of the values of a
            novel like <I>Memories of a Pure Spring,</I> published in January and Vietnamese dissident
            Duong Thu Huong's third to be translated
            into English. After all, there has been no
            great flood of literature to come out of
            the Communist nation in the last 30 years
            (Bao Ninh's now-classic <I>The Sorrow of War</I> or, more recently, Ho Anh Thai's short story
            collection <I>Behind the Red Mist</I> are wonderful anomalies). Instead, our attention
            has been focused curiously on homegrown fiction
            like Robert Olen Butler's short story collection
            <I>A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain,</I> which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in
            1993, and also which, according to a blurb
            on the cover of its Penguin paperback edition,
            &quot;caught for us the Vietnamese sense
            of elegance and delicacy, history and family.&quot;
            <BR>
            <BR>
            In other words, one is tempted to burden
            Huong, who is actually Vietnamese, with explaining
            her people to Americans, with debunking even
            the liberal perspective---as Lam puts it---of
            &quot;Americans as perpetrators of violence
            and Vietnamese as innocents in conical hats,
            waiting to be murdered.&quot; <BR>
            <BR>
            Happily, Huong ignores any such pressure.
            She's the real McCoy, it's true, who presumably
            has worn a conical hat or two and who led
            an artistic troupe and youth brigade in the
            North Vietnamese Army. According to translator
            Nina McPherson, after having spent ten years
            in the tunnels with her group of forty, &quot;singing
            louder than the bombs,&quot; Huong emerged
            one of only three survivors. She joined the
            Communist Party and wrote spectacularly popular
            novels until 1989, when she was rebuked by
            the Party for her criticism of land reform
            in <I>Paradise of the Blind.</I> Her work was quickly banned, and in 1991,
            after smuggling out of the country her manuscript
            for <I>Novel Without a Name</I>, she was jailed for seven months without
            trial. Remarkably, Huong remains in Hanoi,
            where she continues to write, her legend
            broadening and thickening, so that in some
            Western circles she has become a kind of
            literary John McCain. <BR>
            <BR>
            It is precisely because of this biography,
            however, that Huong is able to use her novels
            to speak to Vietnamese. As <I>Novel Without a Name</I> lurches toward its unhappy conclusion, its
            soldier-protagonist Quan is visited
            by a
            war-weary ancestor who dramatically
            announces,
            &quot;History is enmired in crime.&quot;
            This is important news for Quan,
            who, like
            all good Buddhists, worships
            at the altar
            of his ancestors and who, like
            all good NVA,
            uses past, heroic victories to
            justify his
            current suffering. &quot;In my
            time,&quot;
            complains the ghost,
            <BLOCKQUOTE>we killed each other with sabers and lances.
            A letter took a week to reach its destination.
            Humanity was fragmented, cloistered in small,
            savage warrens. We lived in ignorance, isolated,
            like wild beasts, incapable of seeing over
            the bamboo hedgerow ringed with thorns. There
            was no promised land.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            Far from intending this as an excuse for
            Quan to quit the fight, the ancestor informs
            his progeny that &quot;however many generations
            it has been, you belong to me.&quot; You
            owe me. &quot;Don't betray me.&quot; Angrily,
            sadly, guiltily, Quan responds with the jungle
            equivalent of the finger---a triumphant,
            if also tragic, moment for a Vietnamese enmired
            in the maddening circularity of his own difficult
            narrative, unable to blithely dismiss history
            or march beyond it as his American enemy
            has managed. Meanwhile, the distilled force
            of the author's own experience resonates
            in the scene's pain, helping to transform
            a mere assault on ideology into a bristling
            personal revelation. <BR>
            <BR>
            Such a moment also perfectly sets up the
            irony in the title of Huong's latest novel,
            <I>Memories of a Pure Spring.</I> It is the clearly autobiographical love
            story of a composer, Hung, and his devoted
            but much-younger wife, Suong, both veterans
            of a front-line cultural unit and now desperate
            to find some personal, political and professional
            stability in post-war Vietnam. They cannot.
            Hung falls into the bottle and out of favor
            with local Party officials, until he is eventually
            imprisoned. Suong, otherwise successful,
            responds by attempting to drown herself.
            (Huong, meanwhile, inflicts deliciously black
            irony on poor Hung. Arrested for fleeing
            the coast with boat people, he had only joined
            the group after being threatened. He had
            run away from his domestic troubles, you
            see, and passed out drunk beneath a pile
            of fishing nets. When the boat people found
            him, they kidnapped him as insurance on his
            silence.) <BR>
            <BR>
            After his release---secured by Suong, who
            uncomfortably uses her fame as a singer and
            her wiles as a woman on the camp warden---Hung
            drifts. In the space of only a few pages,
            he witnesses &quot;a rain that crushed the
            land, reduced gardens to mud, that churned
            and swelled the rivers,&quot; only to then
            find &quot;enchanting,&quot; &quot;unbridled&quot;
            freedom in the water of the sea: &quot;He
            discovered the sea---not the sea of this
            S-shaped country, but the sea of the sea:
            the free, unbridled sea that belonged to
            no one, that answered to no one, that was
            no one's slave. Mesmerized, he gazed into
            the vast expanse of the water as if he too
            could vanish into its endless churning.&quot;
            <BR>
            <BR>
            For Hung, though, these epiphanies are too
            little, too late. Such optimism, after all,
            might have helped prevent an ever-more-miserable
            Suong from being caught in the &quot;endless
            churning.&quot; What they do accomplish is
            to turn his face away from family and inexorably
            toward his art, a similar turn made by Quan
            in <I>Novel Without a Name,</I> when he spat back at the ghost, &quot;I
            don't give a damn about your triumphal arches,
            or you. Stop bothering me. I've had enough.&quot;
            Hung doesn't have the tongue for such a declaration;
            instead, he moves in with a small group of
            poets and painters, until he washes up almost
            dead in a remote opium den. <BR>
            <BR>
            <I>Memories of a Pure Spring</I> is a novel that, like Vietnam itself, twists
            and churns, backtracks and races forward,
            while always turning the screws on its characters
            with authority and anguish. Nowhere is this
            more the case than in the climactic eleventh
            chapter, wherein Hung, who has gone missing
            from home, engages in stuporous debate with
            his miscreant friends. Again, it is water---or
            rather &quot;plantain leaves, shaken by the
            rain, shuddered, bending and rising, infinitely
            patient, resisting the downpour&quot;---that
            triggers in Hung some kind of release, pathetic
            as it is courageous: &quot;You can only create
            art when you live with dignity, in a free
            society,&quot; he says. &quot;Even a slave
            knows how to put pen to paper, or mix colors
            on a palette. But a cowardly, servile, hypocritical
            soul can never create art.&quot; <BR>
            <BR>
            Hung's colleague Doan then questions him
            as if he were a trial witness, provoking
            frustrated laughter, until it is revealed
            that their conversation has been secretly
            recorded. It is one final, almost unbearable
            cruelty, Hung, wracked by drugs, alcohol
            and self-doubt, on the lam from his loved
            ones and From a watchful government, is able
            just once to &quot;sing louder than the bombs.&quot;
            So when Doan runs for it, there is &quot;rain,
            still rain. Water and more water, white sheets
            of it, as far as the eye could see. In a
            flash, Doan had disappeared.&quot; <!--END BODY TEXT--></TD>

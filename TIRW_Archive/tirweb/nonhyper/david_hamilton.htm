              CITIES---<I>a late review</I> </font></b></font> 
              <P><font color="#CC00CC"><b>Professor Emilio Andante approached 
                me at the cafe after glancing at the book that I read. It was, 
                he offered, the very best guide to the intricate city we found 
                ourselves in. &quot;Turn to page eighty-five,&quot; he instructed. 
                &quot;The first paragraph. Have you ever read a better description? 
                And from Kublai Khan, who never visited.&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Khan didn't visit, he conquered, I 
                reminded. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But not Venice. Avoiding warriors 
                on horses is what drove folks out to these islands in the first 
                place, either that or the dream of constructing the city least 
                likely, a marble snowflake on water. Now twelve million of us 
                storm their work each year. But the Khan learned to see it from 
                afar, under the influence of his chatty friend---who in his own 
                book, by the way, described just about the same number of all-but-invisible 
                and improbably named cities as Calvino has him do here.&quot; 
                <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My new friend proved to be a <I>professore 
                andante,</I> always briefly at rest in a new position, and so 
                he had taken the name. He pursued his itinerant calling with an 
                almost dogged flourish. His black linen suit had weathered long 
                summers on three continents. His bright sea of a blue silk tie 
                echoed Mediterranean tiles with their hints of almonds and oranges. 
                </b></font><BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#333399">&nbsp;&quot;What are thongs?&quot; 
                Andante asked. Both he and I should have prospered in the twelfth 
                century when late Latin was the lagoon into which Venice, Valencia, 
                Avignon, and Vienna all drained. Neither of us could compose a 
                sentence in it, not with a dependent clause anyway, but such would 
                have been our common project then. We would have rhymed a good 
                many too, whereas now we simply tried to decipher a few plaques 
                on old walls. Our native languages varying, though, I wasn't sure 
                just what he had said---something like &quot;tong,&quot; and I 
                let his question pass. Andante seemed to let his attention drift 
                on a canal at our side while he fingered his moustache. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doesn't the Khan get it perfectly?&quot; 
                he mused. &quot;'Princely palaces with marble doorsteps immersed 
                in the water; the bustle of light craft zig-zagging, driven by 
                oars.' I grant you we converse over outboards now, but who put 
                it better? Turn the leaf to Polo's reply. All his cities are versions 
                of Venice, the archetypal city---streets, canals, churches, and 
                squares, but no suburbs---only an interlace of palace, plaza, 
                tenement, and mall. For Polo, every possible city derives from 
                improbable, fading Venice. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now count pages,&quot; he commanded, 
                &quot;both forward and back. Calvino places Polo's secret at the 
                exact center of his book. Rather than seeking a mere ending, you 
                learn to wend your way first toward then away from the hub of 
                his wheel. Who's to say that we're not now, at this very table, 
                at the exact center of Venice.&quot; While he spoke, I sat counting 
                pages and only found all he said to be true. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's a thong?&quot; Andante repeated. 
                This time I could not pretend not to hear. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's that least of garments, that which 
                frames and embraces the posterior, the derriere that smiles so 
                becomingly from the poster in the pharmacy window across the square. 
                Or there, only seemingly shy, under the white skirt you too just 
                noticed passing. Why?</font> <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0099CC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm a student 
                of minimal difference, especially when it maximizes, and I overheard 
                a verse yesterday that said, I believe, 'They knelt in a throng/ 
                To worship the thong.' That last word threw me.&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me too, I replied, though that poster's 
                as close as I've ever got. Do you remember more? <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Something about 'penance.'&quot; 
                <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Venice I assume. An imperfect rhyme, 
                but what do you expect when Irish cross with the Norse and their 
                progeny roam south. So,</font></P>
              <BLOCKQUOTE> 
                <P><font color="#0099CC">A shining young nun of old Venice <BR>
                  Drove priest after priest to his penance . . .</font></P>
              </BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P><font color="#0099CC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; 
                Andante joined in, &quot;'They knelt in a throng/ To worship the 
                thong . . .' you see, such a <I>sottil,</I> I think you would 
                say 'thin' difference. The slightest omission makes a new, and 
                dare I say rounder, more radiant word.&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an absence makes a presence, no? 
                A conference must be convening even now in California. Andante 
                smiled, but not, I think, out of eagerness to attend. He preferred 
                to tell me more about what I read.<BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Calvino's chapters throng too in 
                their way, traversing their own <I>sottil</I> divisions. 'Cities 
                and Memory,' then across the divide, linked and sweetly joined, 
                you'll find <I>Narcoste,</I> how do you say? 'Hidden Cities.' 
                'Cities and Desire' pairs similarly with 'Continuous Cities,' 
                for what is more continuous than desire?&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes, when it ceases to continue, it 
                ceases to be desire. So each set has its partner, drawn together 
                as if murmuring cheek to cheek. &quot;Cities and Signs&quot; pairs 
                then with &quot;Cities and the Sky,&quot; for where else have 
                we always looked for signs? </font><BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#CC3333">&nbsp;&quot;Exactly, and 
                what does 'Trade' depend on more than on one's mark or 'Name'? 
                Appropriate for Venice, a city of shopkeepers, don't you think? 
                That leaves the 'Dead' matched with 'Thin,' or as Calvino said, 
                <I>Sottil </I>cities. Most fortunate for Venice.&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, what a clutter it would be if the 
                dead didn't thin out to that cypress-ringed cemetery island across 
                the water that &quot;makes a sottil garland for hir head.&quot; 
                <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that?&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a scrap of Chaucer, who may have 
                known Venice too. Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch all did. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What Oulipo privileges they would 
                have had. Calvino sat with that group, you know, giving as good 
                as he got. Now number the chapters from front to back and again 
                from back to front, 1-55 either way. You'll find the distribution 
                of any set is always an exact mirror image of its partner, 'Cities 
                and Desire,' for example, take positions 3-5-8-12 and 16, and 
                'Continuous Cities' the same, though counting from the end, from 
                the posterior. One cheek reflects the other you could say.&quot; 
                <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever known an Albert Howard Carter, 
                III? I asked. I think he once charted, elegantly, something of 
                this fugue-like stream. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Astonishing, and where did he do 
                that?&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he began his work at Iowa. <BR>
                <font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Idaho, you 
                say. Never heard of him.&quot; </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More's the pity, I thought, overlooking 
                his last less than minimal difference. But fifty-five chapters, 
                that's an uneven eleven sets of five. They can't all be paired.<BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Leaving 'Cities and Eyes' don't 
                you see? Distributed exactly through the middle, with nineteen 
                chapters before its first instance and nineteen after its last, 
                the set strung out on intervals of four, unmatched, and for precisely 
                that reason soliciting our special regard. For where does that 
                thong lead your eye may I ask?&quot; <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what I do not see but of which I have 
                been known to dream? <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As to 'invisible cities' --- 'Expressing 
                such in-<I>differance.'</I> I think you've got it now.&quot; With 
                an index finger, Andante brushed his moustache as if that motion 
                were his mantra. <BR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Campari and soda? Tomorrow perhaps 
                we should stroll the Biennale.&quot;</font></P>

reports that Helios, the <A HREF="midday.html">Sun God</A>, &quot;has
not much mythology ... He is regularly conceived as a charioteer,
who drives daily from east to west across the sky. The question
how he got back again during the night was apparently discussed
very early ... the quaint solution evolved that he floated around
the earth by the stream of Ocean in a huge cup.&quot;</FONT></P>

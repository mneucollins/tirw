<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A frequent dream: My family gathers
for dinner at Woolworth's. The dream is black and white; therefore,
the scene must take place before the advent of color TV. There is a war bonds
poster for sale on the wall, but my family has never been much
for politics and my mother has a rule: we shall only talk about
pleasant things at the table, like her nervous breakdown. Tonight,
the topic is my cooking, and my sister wants to know what I put
in the <I>osso buco</I>. When I refuse to tell, she starts to
cry.</FONT></P>

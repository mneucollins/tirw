reports that Helios, the Sun God, &quot;has not much mythology
... He is regularly conceived as a charioteer, who drives daily
from east to west across the sky. The question how he got back
again during the night was apparently discussed very early ...
the quaint solution evolved that he floated around the earth by
the stream of Ocean in a huge cup.&quot;</FONT></P>

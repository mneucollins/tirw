<TD COLSPAN="10"><H3><FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">I looked past him, through the arched doorway
into the kitchen. The stove was crowded with dishes of baccala and scungigli,
calamari and breaded eel. On one plate mussels were piled high in a pyramid
and I watched the crusted black shells and dried-up slivers of orange meat
inside them like they might talk to me. I acted like I hadn't heard him.</FONT></H3>

with a green towel, drying her hair. &quot;I'll take him,&quot; she said.
&quot;I don't mind.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">She said something in Italian. Her black hair
was wet and strands were stuck to her forehead and her cheeks. I didn't
understand what she said but the way she held her hands on her hips with
her elbows flying out from her body and the way she leaned toward him I
knew she was trying.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">He barked something back in Italian and she didn't
say another word.</FONT></H3>

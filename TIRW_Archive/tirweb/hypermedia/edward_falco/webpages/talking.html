 COLOR="#EEEEEE"> I fell asleep over this vent night after night. I had
nightmares all the time. Dreams from which I'd wake up sweating. Try to
scream find my throat dry and scratchy. I'd lie down by the vent in the
light that seeped up from the living room where my mother and father would
be up late watching TV--and some nights, if the TV wasn't going if they
weren't fighting some nights they'd sit at the table, talking. Those nights
the way they talked was different. It wasn't somebody always yelling at
somebody. There was a back-and-forth, a quiet rocking. I could hardly ever
make out a full sentence. I wasn't someplace else. I wouldn't have when
they were talking I always wanted.</FONT></H3>

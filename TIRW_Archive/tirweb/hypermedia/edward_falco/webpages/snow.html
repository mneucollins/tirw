all the way back to Brooklyn. When we got back to Ainslie Street the man
next door was parked in front of the house and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">he
had told this man that he considered the space in front of his</FONT> <FONT
 COLOR="#EEEEEE">house to be <I>his</I> parking spot and no one else should
park</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">there. So the guy was parked his parking
space</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">he was furious in the car with his whole
family--all of us half asleep in the back seat. So he</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">slammed
the car into the neighbor's car we went flying into the</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">front
seat the guy's car wound up on the sidewalk. Then the wife came screaming
with a fork raised over her</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">head like a dagger
and that was that. Ten minutes and the whole</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">neighborhood
was out on the street fighting. Everybody screaming</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">and
fighting and then it started to snow. </FONT></H3>

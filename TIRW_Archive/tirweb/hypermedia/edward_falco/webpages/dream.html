After my father died I</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">had a terrible dream.
I was all</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">alone in my house, and I went from
room to room looking for something</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">but I didn't
know what. And then I went down to the cellar and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">there
was my father, sleeping in his bed, looking all horrible. 'Dad,' I said,
'What are you doing sleeping in the cellar?'</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">&quot;He picked up his hand just a little bit
and waved for me to come</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">closer. I was afraid
of how ugly he was and I didn't want to go</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">but
he was my father so I went and stood beside the bed and looked</FONT> <FONT
 COLOR="#EEEEEE">down at his horrible face. 'What?' I asked and he whispered
something</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">I could barely hear and when I leaned
closer he grabbed</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">me around the neck tight
with both hands and pulled me down and</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">kissed
me on the lips. I fought and fought but I couldn't get</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#EEEEEE">free
of him. It was like he was trying to suck my soul out of me.</FONT> <FONT
 COLOR="#EEEEEE">And I couldn't get free.&quot;</FONT></H3>

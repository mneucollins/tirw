couch her head on the armrest and her feet on the floor as if she wants
to lie down but is afraid to get too comfortable lest she fall asleep. She
holds a spatula in front of her clasped in both hands as if it's a sword
and she's about to dub a knight. Her flowered housedress bunches up just
above her knees. Her hair in rollers covered by a kerchief. I watch her
through the archway between the kitchen and living room.</FONT></H3>

at each other. To walk into the living room you must pass under their gaze.</FONT></H3>

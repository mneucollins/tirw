<TD ROWSPAN="2"><H3>I was afraid of the flight of stairs between the living room and the
bedrooms because the hallway was always so dark. There were no windows.
There was no light, unless the door to the bedrooms or living room was open,
allowing a little light to spill out onto the landing.</H3>

<TD ROWSPAN="2" COLSPAN="3"><H3>At night in the hallway with the doors closed, it was so dark I couldn't
see my fingers held directly in front of my eyes--but it wasn't just the
darkness that scared me. Alongside the stairway, from the bottom step to
about two-thirds of the way up, there was an empty space that led under
the stairs, and it was that empty space that terrified me. I could never
walk up that flight of stairs in total dark without imagining there was
something there, something that hid under the stairs, and came out of that
empty space, something that might leap at me, might grab me by the ankle
and pull me down.</H3>

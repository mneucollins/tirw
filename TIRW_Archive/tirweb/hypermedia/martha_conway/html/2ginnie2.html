We touched all the time, even at dinner, and sometimes I pretended that she was the woman whose husband had disappeared and I was the husband who returned.&nbsp; Maybe we even had a child or maybe she was the child, though in many ways she was old and worn out already and her face looked like a young boy's face with makeup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mornings I chose Ginnie's clothes for her when she needed me to and I began reading a book to her about the Alexander Technique, which if done correctly can improve both posture and self-esteem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></B></P><P>&nbsp;</P>

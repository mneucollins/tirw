	<TD WIDTH=367><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After a few weeks of driving around reading signs stapled to telephone poles Betsey and I found an apartment in the tenderloin near a residents' hotel where another friend of mine worked, and the three of us began a regular schedule of juice fasting which we were mistakenly told would calm our vibrational field.&nbsp; Everything seemed like it might work at first.&nbsp; The fasts lasted for four or five days but we were allowed water and carrots and seasonal fruits.&nbsp; During the fasts Betsey grew pale and her mouth tasted like lime and once when we made love she fainted and I eased myself off her quickly as though I had at last done something outside the law, a feeling both thrilling and shameful.&nbsp; I looked at her still body lying there as skinny as a junkie's and I wondered, is she dead?&nbsp; She could have been dead.&nbsp; I didn't believe it but still I felt strangely close to her then since usually she talked all the time, talked or laughed in her motor-like voice, and who was I in comparison, a boy who at twelve wore black mascara and at fourteen was shooting speed up my nose because I could not deal with after-school chitchat.&nbsp; When Betsey came to a few seconds later her eyes were very red at the rims which might have been the beginnings of allergies -- on the days the wind blew from the east, which was not very often, we all got scratchy throats due to toxic leaks from the Richmond Chevron refinery.&nbsp; To offset this and other maladies we began to take zinc. </FONT></B></P><P>&nbsp;</P>

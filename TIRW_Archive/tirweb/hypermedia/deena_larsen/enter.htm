         <P><B>Ten dollars for twenty tickets, says the lady in her
         red Taste of Colorado teeshirt. A line drawing of a half
         eaten watermelon slice on the front of her shirt almost
         matches the cotton candy she has in one hand, which is
         leaving spider strands of sugar all over the tickets. She is
         looking over at a bare chested guy about six feet away, who
         is lovingly handling a thick boa, letting it play over his
         washboard muscles. She cranes her neck for a better
         view.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         We do not know how much the Ferris wheel costs, and ask her.
         Ya gotta buy tickets, she says.  Ten dollars for twenty
         tickets.  We tell her we know this, but we just want to ride
         the ferris wheel and want to know how many tickets we need. 
         She shrugs her shoulders and brushes her neck as if she
         could feel the snake rippling over her shoulders.  I can't
         tell you what you need, she says.  You have to figure it out
         for yourselves.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         We decide to buy twenty tickets. If we don't need this many,
         you say, I will find a kid who wants them. A girl in tight
         ponytails and white shorts turns at this pronouncement and
         looks like she is ready to follow us anywhere.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I turn to look at her and she melts away, as though I had
         only seen her at the edge of my eyes, I hold your hand
         tightly. I always wanted <A HREF="false.htm">tickets to
         rides</A> when I was a kid, I say. And I reach for my money.
         My idea, I tell you.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         You <A HREF="every.htm"> pay anyway</A>.  You always do. 
         Its the man's job, you say.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I snuggle into your shoulder.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         We wait our turn.<BR>

<P><B>It's the Taste of Colorado--and I have dragged you
         here. My yearly ritual. Denver opens summer with the
         crowded, rock-thrumming craft booths of the People's Fair,
         ends it with these sticky asphalt, <A HREF="enter.htm">
         cotton candy</A>, carny crowds. We have escaped the noise of
         the KBPI radio booth on Colfax, set up on the Courthouse
         steps where I got my divorce about two years ago. A booth
         advertising buffalo gyros and green pepper salsa covers the
         step where I stood and cried for four and half hours. We
         wander around the raucous, overpriced food booths that are
         trampling the pines and marvel that the intricate flower
         gardens between the courthouse and the capitol are
         <A HREF="reality.htm"> still intact</A>.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         We pass in front of the shallow pool where I ran into you a
         little less than a year ago. I was watching the kids try to
         ride the blue brass dolphins and you were biking wildly,
         trying to get out of the crush of downtown cars and people.
         You thought you could take a shortcut through Civic Park
         onto the Platte bikeway. You missed the road and we
         collided. I knocked off your glasses, recognized you from
         college. We forgot our other plans and went off to the
         Walnut Cafe for coffee. And talked all night.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         Now we have had too many dates to count. You hold my hand
         and whisper in my ear, deftly avoiding the kid in the baggy
         pants and skull-capped skateboard.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         You want a commitment, you say, your hands nuzzling under my
         hair.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I shiver under the warmth of your fingers.<BR>
         
         Look, a ferris wheel, I say.<BR>
         
         Let's go.<BR>

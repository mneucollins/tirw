<P><B>The ferris wheel stops for a moment and we catch our
         breath.  We are looking east over the somehow scrawny
         skyscrapers of downtown, the heads of the crowds toward
         Denver International Airport's whitecaps in the distance. We
         start swinging slowly in unison, the metal rocking beneath
         us as the car slowly lifts and then jerks swiftly to a stop.
         The lip of the car hits my neck, hits the swell of your
         back. I lean into the warm yellow plastic. Look up into the
         sky. Look, I say, you can see where the <A HREF="stars.htm">
         moon will rise</A>. You laugh.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         We gaze at the cloud strewn horizon, wondering what is real
         and what is merely water vapor. We still swing softly,
         slowly. Your hand grasps mine.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I love you, you say. Your voice is smiling and I shrug into
         your arm, now protecting my head from the shiny stickiness
         of bare plastic.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I look at you. Loving you is something that I no longer
         question. That isn't why I haven't given you an answer. 
         It's not why I am hesitating, my lips unwilling to form the
         words, yes.  Love is definitely not the issue. <BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         The issue is living with you. Being there again through
         thick and thin, better or worse, richer or poorer. Which is
         a promise I have made before. And one I wasn't able to keep
         then.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         What makes me think I can keep it now? Why do I think I can
         swim against the tides of <A HREF="turn.htm"> fate</A> yet
         once more?<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I say nothing.</B>

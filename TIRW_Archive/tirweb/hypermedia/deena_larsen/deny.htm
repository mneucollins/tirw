<P><B>There are not that many people in the ferris wheel
         line. You start counting the couples and the empty cars. We
         won't have to wait very long, you say. How do you know the
         <A HREF="friend.htm"> people will stay</A> in couples? I
         ask. It is easy, you say. Just watch them.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         The ferris wheel has begun to shudder to a stop. A boy about
         two with a sticky lollipop gets off and starts running
         through the crowd before his mother can extricate the
         remaining child--a larger girl with vacuous eyes. She yells
         at the crowd to stop him, but <A HREF="reach.htm"> they do
         nothing</A>.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         You squeeze my hand and leave me to run after the kid. I
         watch as you part the crowd, your hands spreading people
         away like the shallow waves of the Red Sea. The child
         stumbles and starts to cry, not very far from the ferris
         wheel line. You offer him your hand and I think I can see
         your smile from here. He cries louder and points to his
         shoe. You kneel like a lord and gently tie the shoe up. The
         mother arrives, breathless, carrying the girl half in, half
         out of an oversized stroller. You talk with her, stroking
         the boy's hair. Her back blocks my view so I cannot see your
         smile now, but I imagine it. I imagine she smiles back at
         you.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I nod to myself, smiling, as you rejoin me.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         Thanks, I say.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         You would have done the same, you say.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         No, I say. I would have been too afraid to care.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         Are you sure? you ask.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         I shrug my shoulders.</B> <B>&nbsp;</B> <B>&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;

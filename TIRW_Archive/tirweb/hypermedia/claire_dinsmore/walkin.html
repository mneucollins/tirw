      <p>Simply put, a walk-in is a soul who is invited to complete a life in 
        progress by a soul who wants out or, is simply done with the life. While 
        walk-ins do not assume the karma of the outgoing soul, they do take responsibility 
        for the things that have already been set in motion ie: family responsibilities, 
        children, etc. The exchange is always for a specific service to humanity 
        and is never forced. There is evidence to suggest that agreements are 
        made between lifetimes. <font color="#9B8C6A"><b><font color="#800000">How 
        did this happen? </font> </b></font></p>
      <p>Some walk-ins say that their host soul never walked out, that the one 
        who walked in was not a different soul but merely a higher aspect of their 
        own oversoul who came to begin the service. </p>
      <p>Others say they are sharing a body with another dimensional being who 
        is wiser, more spiritually enlightened. One who can see the overall picture 
        and guide the work. Still others say their bodies have been host several 
        soul exchanges, each completing a task and taking the consciousness higher. 
        Whether there is a merging or an actual exchange, the person is in for 
        a great deal of change, turmoil and confusion, because the exchange is 
        rarely a conscious one. </p>
      <p><b><font color="#800000">What changes occur ?</font></b> </p>
      <p>Although walk-ins go through tremendous upheaval and change, there may 
        be other causes for such events, such as spontaneous kundalini rising, 
        a step up in spiritual awareness, seeming mental instability, chemical 
        imbalance and so forth. Other walk-ins and some psychics can usually tell 
        that there is a different kind of 'depth' in the eyes. or, perhaps a seeming 
        vacancy. </p>
      <p>There seems to also share other common-alities... most divorce the spouse 
        of the former occupant unless the spouse moves ahead with them spiritually. 
        Almost all change their name - taking on or adopting - a spiritual name 
        and many move to a new location. </p>
      <p><b><font color="#800000">Where do walk-ins come from? </font></b></p>
      <p>So far we know of five origins (or vibrations) that walk-ins come from 
        - as reported by walk-ins themselves - those who come from a <i>hierarchic 
        origin</i> (Christian, Buddhist, etc.), those who come from an <i>Interplanetary 
        Alliance</i> (Pleiades, Arcturus, Sirius, etc.) those who come from a 
        <i>Group Soul origin </i>(Oversoul, Master Soul, Family Soul, etc.) and 
        those who come from a <i>Universal origin</i> (Spirit, Creative Energy, 
        Universal Mind., etc.) or, those who come from the <i>Angelic Realm. </i></p>
      <p><b><font color="#800000">Am I a Walk-in?</font></b> </p>
      <p>A scary thought? A curious thought? In the final analysis, only you can 
        answer that question... however, the <i>WE International</i>, a non-profit 
        organization of Walk-ins and Walk-alongs, people who are interested in 
        the <i>Walk-in phenomenon </i>and those who wish to support its mission 
        and purpose, are here to help you understand. </p>

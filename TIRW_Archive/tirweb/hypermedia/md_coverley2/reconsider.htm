    <p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style">In 1981, a co-worker and close friend of
    mine, Clara Tatiana Walser, was assigned to an official Trade Delegation in Russia. The
    group was interested in business prospects for natural resources--the tracts of timber,
    pools of oil, deposits of palladium--and human labor resources, as well, of that region of
    the globe. <br>
    <br>
    The city in which she was stationed--a stately city on a river with a harbor--was in the
    north.<br>
    <br>
    Her job as a mid-level researcher required top-security clearance at the time. &nbsp;
    Although Clara found it difficult to live always under surveillance and out of touch with
    her friends and family here at home, she liked the city very much. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Since communication was uncertain, her letters came through unofficial diplomatic mail
    (that is, hand-carried by our committee members who entered or left the country).&nbsp;
    The censors tended to object less to letters written in Russian--if they could read the
    letter, they were less suspicious.&nbsp; I translated the letters and forwarded them to
    her family. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Our system worked well for some years. Her posts to me were always short and personal; she
    avoided political issues. When the political climate of both countries warmed up a bit,
    and Clara could resume other connections, my job as intermediary was no longer
    necessary--but I enjoyed the occasional note, a photo or two.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style">Along the way, in the file I kept, I
    began accumulating clippings from the newspapers, and, later, downloads from the Internet.
    &nbsp; I did not send these to Clara.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Last month, I got a post card from Mikhail, her Russian lover, informing me that Clara had
    died in a seacoast town, Tiksi, in the far north. And then, just days ago, a letter came
    from Clara.&nbsp; It was dated before her death. <br>

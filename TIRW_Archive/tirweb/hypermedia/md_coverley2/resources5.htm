<!--Economic Statistics -- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Russia's economy is undergoing  serious difficulties.  Spillover from the ongoing  East Asian economic crisis,  as well as a sharp fall in the price  of oil and gas - the  source of almost 40% of Russia's hard  currency earnings and export revenues -  has led to increased pressures on Russia's  currency, the ruble. Russia's crude oil  export revenues fell by 25% during the  first half of 1998 compared with the  same period last year. In addition,  natural gas export revenues were  down 18% during the same period.  After several failed rescue attempts  by international lenders, Russia  announced  on August 17, 1998 that efforts to  maintain a stable ruble would be  abandoned. The ruble was allowed to  float freely against other currencies,  a 90-day moratorium on foreign debt  payments was imposed, and  negotiations  were started to restructure Russia's  short-term debt.

Spillover from the ongoing  East Asian economic crisis,  as well as a sharp fall in the price  of oil and gas - the  source of almost 40% of Russia's hard  currency earnings and export revenues -  has led to increased pressures on Russia's  currency, the ruble. Russia's crude oil  export revenues fell by 25% during the  first half of 1998 compared with the  same period last year. In addition,  natural gas export revenues were  down 18% during the same period.  After several failed rescue attempts  by international lenders, Russia  announced  on August 17, 1998 that efforts to  maintain a stable ruble would be  abandoned. The ruble was allowed to  float freely against other currencies,  a 90-day moratorium on foreign debt  payments was imposed, and  negotiations  were started to restructure Russia's  short-term debt.

Economic Statistics -- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Russia's economy is undergoing  serious difficulties.  Spillover from the ongoing  East Asian economic crisis,  as well as a sharp fall in the price  of oil and gas - the  source of almost 40% of Russia's hard  currency earnings and export revenues -  has led to increased pressures on Russia's  currency, the ruble. Russia's crude oil  export revenues fell by 25% during the  first half of 1998 compared with the  same period last year. In addition,  natural gas export revenues were  down 18% during the same period.  After several failed rescue attempts  by international lenders, Russia  announced  on August 17, 1998 that efforts to  maintain a stable ruble would be  abandoned. The ruble was allowed to  float freely against other currencies,  a 90-day moratorium on foreign debt  payments was imposed, and  negotiations  were started to restructure Russia's  short-term debt.

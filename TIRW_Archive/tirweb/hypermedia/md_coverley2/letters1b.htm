    Dear Laura:<br>
    <br>
    I am sending this letter to you through Mr. Royce. Hope he remembers to drop it off with
    you. I would appreciate it if you could also mail the letter and duplicate photos for my
    Mom. <br>
    <br>
    You were the first to warn me against taking this job--so far from home and such a strange
    place! And, as usual, your insight, foresight, were infallible. Still, I have endured. I
    have a nice room in a private house here--a luxury in itself. My landlady, Alyona, and her
    daughter, Evgeny, are most considerate. (The photo is of Alyona taking me shopping on the
    Nevsky Prospekt). Just now, the winter is about to loosen its hold on us for a few weeks.
    Soon everyone will joyfully throw coats and cares aside and stroll along the avenues, lean
    out over the sapphire blue canals, laugh in the white light of the midnight sun. This is a
    beautiful city.<br>
    <br>
    Still, the dark, first few months would have been grim without the companionship of one of
    the officials here--a scientist with the government--Mikhail Pyotr Berglund. He's of mixed
    descent (half Swedish). His research is mostly in the arctic and he spends summers
    searching the northernmost seas. We have planned a celebration for the magic night--right
    before he leaves.<br>
    <br>
    I am not sure how much our little committee will accomplish here, but I can tell you that
    the natives believe the atmosphere is changing. A global warming of the hands at the
    campfire of freedom. There is much suppressed optimism. <br>
    Mr. Royce will return here in July, so you can send letters with him.<br>
    <br>
    Your friend, Clara<br>

    <p>Russian Nuke Arsenal <a name="Falling Apart">Falling Apart </a></p>
    <p><tt>By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer</TT></p><tt>
    <p>MOSCOW (AP) - At the height of Russia's financial meltdown, the minister named to save
    the economy outlined an overriding priority: build a new generation of nuclear missiles.</p>
    <p>The warning from First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, first made in October,
    that Russia could lose its nuclear capability, has produced rare unanimity among the
    country's bitterly divided political factions.</p>
    <p>Communists, nationalists and liberals alike agree that Russia must stake everything on
    its nuclear forces if it wants any claim to be a world power and have any kind of credible
    military.</p>
    <p>Yet, the huge arsenal of rockets, planes and submarines that once terrified the world
    is falling apart and there is no money to maintain it or build large numbers of
    replacements.</p>
    <p><tt>``The only thing for which Russia is respected in the world and which makes us
    worthy partners ... is our strategic rocket forces,'' said Alexander Lebed, a former
    general and a leading presidential candidate.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>Russia's nuclear arsenal of 6,000 warheads could soon shrink to just a few hundred,
    analysts say. Early-warning radar and satellites vital to protect against pre-emptive
    attacks and prevent premature missile launchings are also falling apart, they add.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>``By the year 2010, the number of Russia's nuclear warheads will fall 10-fold to
    600 to 800,'' predicted Alexander Pikayev, a top expert in arms control with Moscow's
    branch of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>Russia could be eclipsed as a nuclear power by China, which once lagged far behind
    Moscow, he said.</tt></p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="russgas.gif" width="382" height="314"
    alt="russgas.gif (4909 bytes)"> </p>
    <p><tt>Analysts paint a gloomy picture of Russia's crumbling nuclear triad:</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>- The navy's nuclear missile submarines are in the worst state. During the
    Soviet-era, dozens of submarines were on patrol, lurking under the waves with batteries of
    nuclear missiles ready for instant firing. Scores of submarines have been decommissioned
    and no more than three are thought to be on patrol at any one time now. Even the working
    boats rarely leave harbor.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>And if a nuclear war starts, the submarines wouldn't be able to sail out
    immediately because they don't have food supplies on board.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>- The air force's mainstay Bear bombers are more than 40 years old. Pilots only get
    a few hours flying time each year, far below the level at which they can operate
    effectively, analysts said. Lebed said the air force has only 20 modern nuclear bombers.</tt>
    </p>
    <p><tt>- The land-based rocket forces, always the strongest part of the Soviet nuclear
    triad, are in better shape. But many of the most powerful missiles are well past their
    operational lifetime, officials admit.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>Nuclear weapons have a limited lifespan because of their atomic warheads and
    corrosive fuel. Beyond that lifespan they often are incapable of working or function
    defectively.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>``The strategic nuclear forces' command systems are also expiring, and that may
    result in loss of control over them,'' Lebed wrote in a Jan. 21 article in the
    Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>It would cost $3 billion a year to maintain existing missiles, according to Roman
    Popkovich, head of the defense committee of the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament.
    Russia's full budget for 1999 is $25 billion, and officials concede much of the money
    exists only on paper.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>With the economy in a nose dive and conventional forces collapsing, Russia's
    military has become increasingly dependent on its still massive Soviet-era nuclear forces.</tt>
    </p>
    <p><tt>Whatever money the government can scrape together for the military is being
    funneled into nuclear forces, but analysts say it's too little, too late.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>The navy designed a new nuclear missile submarine - the Yuri Dolgoruky - but only
    one is under construction. ``It's really difficult to say how many nuclear submarines
    Russia will have on duty by 2010 - two, four, five or seven,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a
    leading analyst.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>The air force does not have any plans for a new long-range nuclear bomber or cruise
    missiles, analysts said.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>The land forces alone have a new weapon - the Topol-M - a single-warhead missile,
    10 of which were deployed for the first time in January.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>But even if Russia meets its goal of building between 35 and 40 Topol-Ms a year,
    analysts say the nuclear forces will still drop drastically. Some officials advocate
    building multi-warhead missiles, but this would break the proposed START-2 agreement with
    the United States.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>The Communist-dominated Duma repeatedly has refused to ratify the treaty, which was
    approved by the U.S. Senate in 1996 and would reduce each side's nuclear arsenals to
    between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads by 2007.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>Government officials say Moscow must accept START-2 and seek a START-3 treaty to
    cut both sides to about 1,500 nuclear warheads as the only way to give Russia some kind of
    parity.</tt> </p>
    <p><tt>Such drastic cuts are ``dozens of times more important for our country than for the
    United States,'' said Popkovich, warning that Russia cannot afford any kind of arms race
    with Washington.</tt> </p>

    <b><p align="justify">Now you have opportunity to start your business in Russia. Like many
    other countries, Russia has its own business regulation, traditions, rules which may not
    meet your previous experience. Now Russia becomes more and more integrated with the world
    economy (for example the programme of changing national accounting standards goes on), but
    it remains too different from other developed countries because of its historical
    economical and political separation from the developed world in 1917.</p>

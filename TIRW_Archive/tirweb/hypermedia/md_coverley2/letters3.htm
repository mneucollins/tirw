    Dear Laura:<br>
    <br>
    I am so disappointed and frustrated, I guess I don't care if the censorial snoops see
    this. When last I wrote you, I was anticipating that Mikhail and I would be married in
    June of this year. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier">Suddenly, though, in the way these things happen in Russia, our
    permission just disappeared. I would say there was no reason, but I think there was a
    reason. Mikhail was reassigned to a different agency--a promotion of sorts. But our
    Delegation is not on the approved list, so we couldn't be married because I couldn't go
    north with him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier">He has been gone since June 14, in S., and I have heard nothing.
    The good news is that he gets to keep the apartment here. So, I am spending my free time
    this summer stitching up curtains, dish cloths, and table settings so that he will feel at
    home when he returns in September. I, however, continue to live officially at Alyona's.
    (photo is of Alyona's daughter and her friend). Perhaps the political situation will
    improve by next year, and we can enter a proper married life. <br>
    <br>
    Love, Clara</font></p>

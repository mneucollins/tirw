       Where, choppy &amp; not a little violent, our <font size="-1">JAWS</font>
       resonate with each new drilling north of the <font

       Add to this that some authors get sick (e.g., of attention) 
about as often
       as actors, but less often than conductors, &amp; more often 
than <font size="-1">BOOTLEGGERS</font>.
       Interpretation across the generations, maybe. But how to 
transmit the <font size="-1">OOMPH</font>?

What's revealing
       about this scene is how well it's held up lo this past half-century. Many

protoModernist

            &quot;scrolls&quot; of journals intersticed
            with reminiscences, poems, dreams, philosophy
            and critique, with original tropes, such
            as &quot;invagination&quot; (fragments of
            nested quotes). To suggest that words, ideas,
            and innuendoes may lead us elsewhere, there
            are links to a paratext of citations and
            additional information.<BR>

            Scrolls of papyrus, parchment, and other
            skins are one of the oldest formats for the
            transmission of written language. With the
            older rolls, the usual way of writing was
            across their breadth, the scroll held upright
            before the reader and unrolled from the top
            downwards. When we come to the electronic
            text, &quot;scrolling&quot; is its primary
            means of navigating a page.<BR><BR>

                        the site is well-known for its commitment to new writing.</p>
                      <p>Starting in 2002, TIR Web expanded. It now includes--along 
                        with electronic literature--other varieties of experimental 
                        writing and art. It also features interviews with innovative 
                        writers, and critical articles and essays. </p>
                      <p>Each issue of TIR Web includes work from both The Iowa

                      <p>TIR Web adds new work every three months. Much of this 
                        work is solicited by the editors and members of the Advisory 
                        Board. </p>

                        unable to consider work by writers who have not published 
                        previously in major journals or electronic venues. If 
                        you would like us to consider your work, please send us 
                        a query email. </p>

<p><B><A NAME="landon"></A>Brooks Landon</B> is chair of the English Department 
at the University of Iowa. His research and teaching center on the ways in which 
people interact with science and technology, whether that interaction emerges 
in explicit science fiction texts or in implicit science fiction thinking. Put 
another way, his fascination is with the moments when something almost is science 
fiction and when science fiction almost isn't. Issues of digital culture and of 
electronic textuality are central to both moments. He is the author of <I>Science 
Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars </I>and of <I>The Aesthetics 
of Ambivalence: Rethinking Science Fiction Film in the Age of Electronic Reproduction.

        <blockquote> 
          <p>Cixous: &quot;Flying is woman's gesture-flying in language and making 
            it fly. We have all learned the art of flying and its numerous techniques; 
            for centuries we've been able to possess anything by flying; we've 
            lived in flights, stealing away, finding, when desired, narrow passageways, 
            hidden crossovers. It's no accident that voler has a double meaning 
            [to fly, to steal], that it plays on each of them and thus throws 
            off the agents of sense&#133;.<br>
            <br>
            What woman hasn't flown/stolen? Who hasn't crumbled, held up to ridicule, 
            the bar of separation? Who hasn't inscribed with her body the differential, 
            punctured the system of couples and opposition?&quot; (258). </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What woman among us? I remember the last time&#151;wasn't that fun 
          when I held up to ridicule the bar of separation; what a hoot that was 
          last time I punctured the system of couples and opposition with my body. 
          I've seen these words quoted a number of times without any accompanying 
          worry about what they might suggest practically. My work on vertical 
          metaphors suggests that flying in language looks, in practice, like 
          taking license, then taking more to bend categories like genre, to strain 
          protocols, to play in the fields of prose or verse. </p>
        <p>Let Genre Bending stand for flying in writing. Let several genres be 
          in question and let them be temporarily resistant to the protocol pressures 
          exerted by the context of an academic conference. Let there be no risk 
          in bending genres at the moment and let not the requirements of any 
          card catalog trouble the critic as she Gets High with Vertical Metaphors 
          in a document referred to as Upwords: </p>
        <p>This study represents an attempt to come to an understanding about 
          the relations among three apparently divergent groups of texts&#151;<i>some 
          faculty of mind (call it Intuition) said, &quot;These go together,&quot; 
          but another faculty of mind (call it Doubt) said, &quot;I doubt it.&quot; 
          Intuition said it could 'sense' the interconnections but Doubt, skeptical 
          regarding Intuition's 'sense' of things, required a demonstration. Compliant 
          to a degree, Intuition asserted that since a medieval mystic climbs 
          a ladder of perfection, since a person diagnosed by the psychiatric 
          establishment with a dissociative disorder claims to float on the ceiling, 
          since in late 20th century novels, characters fly, &quot;these all meet 
          because they all go vertical.&quot; Doubt found this answer to be unsatisfactory, 
          since it consisted of three items and a spatial generalization. &quot;But 
          it's a start!&quot; said Intuition; &quot;hardly,&quot; Doubt rejoined, 
          adding that it didn't care for Intuition's method of exposition. Intuition 
          wanted to know what was wrong with its method. Since the conversation 
          threatened to break down before it had really begun, another faculty 
          of mind (call it Method) stepped in. &quot;Your 'method', Intuition, 
          looks like this: induction rather than deduction, exploration rather 
          than argumentation, description and narration rather than prescription 
          and obvious rhetoric. You prefer to tell stories that have ideas in 
          them. You privilege questions over answers, suspect that the obvious 
          is really complicated, believe that knowing how to use something doesn't 
          mean you understand what it is.&quot; <a href="text2.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></i></p>

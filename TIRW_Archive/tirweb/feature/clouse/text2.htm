          <p><i>Intuition said that all sounded pretty good but Doubt said it sounded 
          like it was going to take forever. &quot;Funny you should say that,&quot; 
          interjected Intuition, &quot;since one of the ideas has to do with time, 
          so bide yours, and let me begin.&quot; <br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>Doubt the staller said okay but only under two conditions and these 
          are what they were: that Method, more trustworthy, should do most of 
          the explaining, and that an introduction should come first to justify 
          the request for time. Intuition was abashed at being so distrusted but 
          gave a little on the first condition, saying &quot;Method can do some 
          jobs.&quot; As for condition number two, it gave a chirpy 'okay' and 
          began its introduction:</i></p>
        <p><i>&nbsp; </i><i>&nbsp; </i><i>&nbsp; </i>Assertion (A) On the first 
          page it is best to begin at the top. <br>
          <i>&nbsp; </i><i>&nbsp; </i><i>&nbsp; </i>Assertion (B) I made that 
          up.</p>
        <p>Here are two assertions that introduce the matter and method of this 
          study. By beginning with two assertions, I suggest that the dominant 
          method of reasoning in the study is inductive rather than deductive. 
          I will add other items that will complicate what I will have to say 
          about the assertions, then&#151;<i>&quot;Foul!&quot; cried Doubt, &quot;That's 
          no introduction. Give me a thesis statement.&quot; Intuition sputtered, 
          &quot;Intuition doesn't do thesis statements.&quot; Doubt said, &quot;You'd 
          better let Method take over.&quot; &quot;But it's my project,&quot; 
          claimed jealous Intuition. &quot;Hey!&quot; said Doubt, &quot;We'll 
          never get anywhere!&quot; &quot;Will too,&quot; said Intuition. &quot;Will 
          not&quot; said Doubt. &quot;Will too&quot; &quot;Will not&quot; &quot;Will 
          too&quot; &quot;Will not&quot; &quot;This is not a fruitful exchange,&quot; 
          assessed Method, launching into an introduction:</i></p>
        <p>We will begin with basics, at the bottom (so to speak)&#151;<i>&quot;Hey! 
          That 'so to speak' isn't Method's! No sneaking Intuition with sotto 
          voce's!&quot; Intuition smugly apologized because Doubt hadn't got it; 
          &quot;I said 'so to speak',&quot; continued Intuition, &quot;because 
          the study is precisely a question of bottom and top.&quot; Doubt didn't 
          wish to appear dense, but asserted the need to maintain protocol: &quot;Let 
          Method tell then; no tricks, no stage asides, no parenthetical statements&#151;&quot; 
          Method, hearing this, anticipated difficulties: &quot;Parenthetical 
          statements are necessary for qualification,&quot; it said. &quot;And 
          because we are talking largely about words, a few puns (of which Intuition 
          made 'bottom' one above) may slip in even from me.&quot; Doubt harumphed 
          and spliced a comma. &quot;Tell me the basic stuff already, I'm getting 
          tired of this conversation.&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Then I shall begin,&quot; said Method. &quot;I shall isolate 
          the subject matter in space and time, identify the three things that 
          Intuition says go together, and describe the hypotheses that have emerged 
          from Intuition's project. Since Intuition has already supplied two assertions, 
          I shall discuss them in both referential and metaphorical terms; this 
          will require a brief foray into the history of language and usage, from 
          which I shall draw some inferences, and then I shall return to the hypotheses 
          for elaboration. I shall be logical, although my logic will be in tension 
          with the whole project because my logic is reasonable and Intuition's 
          logic is metaphorical.&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>Doubt agreed that this was a desirable procedure then sardonically 
          asked for a clue about subject matter. &quot;Haven't you been listening?&quot; 
          challenged Intuition. &quot;Give me one word,&quot; said economical 
          Doubt. &quot;You want one word?&quot; said Intuition, &quot;I'll give 
          you one word. Up.&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Up,&quot; said Doubt, &quot;Your study is about Up.&quot;</i> 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p><i>&quot;That's right,&quot; said merry Intuition, &quot;Isn't that 
          fun?&quot; &quot;What's so fun about Up?&quot; &quot;Oh my,&quot; said 
          Intuition, a little obsessed with its one word, &quot;Up is amazing: 
          wait up, come up, uproar, clean up, up in the air, head in the clouds, 
          hearts soaring, people flying, getting high, reach the top, climb the 
          ladder up to altitude on the vertical till you reach some serious height 
          or call it elevation&#151;uplift, levitate, ascent, high moral purpose, 
          rising, raising, move up, blow up, show up, break up, screw up&#151;&quot; 
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Shut up,&quot; said Doubt. <a href="text3.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></i></p>

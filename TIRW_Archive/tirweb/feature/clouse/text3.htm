        <p><i>Intuition said, &quot;Yes, shut up, too, and clam up, upset, flying 
          high, up, up and away to aerial points of view, waking up, standing 
          up&#151;&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;I mean Shut Up!&quot; Doubt said. Offended Intuition riposted 
          with &quot;Up yours.&quot; Cool Method admonished there was no need 
          to be vulgar. Sotto voce, Intuition mumbled &quot;vulgar, common, low 
          on a vertical scale, plebeian, coarse, earthy, chthonic,&#151;&quot; 
          as Method launched into an introduction:</i></p>
        <p>This study focuses on the linguistic translations of cognitive representations 
          of the vertical dimension described within the limits of Euclidean geometry's 
          construction of the space-time continuum in Western literature and Western 
          experience. This study is not a comprehensive treatise. The majority 
          of primary literary texts under consideration emerge from three discursive 
          formations shot through by a common pattern of figures. Those discursive 
          formations are (1) Contemporary accounts of mental illness, specifically, 
          dissociative disorders, (2) Western medieval texts on mystical experience, 
          (3) Postmodern literature in which machine-free human flying is a dominant 
          element. Texts have been drawn from these discursive formations based 
          on their deployment of figures of vertical mobility. </p>
        <p>This study is concerned chiefly with a set of figures, images, and 
          metaphors. It is exploratory, with an eye trained first at flying and 
          its corollary dimension as a literary and verbal phenomenon, and second 
          on the literary and verbal conditions whose effect is flying, or whose 
          effect is figured as vertical mobility. My investigations suggest this 
          hypothesis: Figures of vertical mobility in a text occur not in isolation 
          but in the context of a specific and dynamic figural set. </p>
        <p>This set consists of figures of fragmentation, enclosure and temporal 
          stasis. Together with vertical mobility, fragmentation, <br>
          enclosure, and temporal stasis are names for image schemas that sponsor 
          literary figures. The ultimate figure of the image schema of vertical 
          mobility is flying; from the image schema of fragmentation issues the 
          figure of bodily dismemberment, from enclosure issues the figure of 
          the tomb (the body, too, may be figured as a prison or a grave), from 
          temporal stasis issues the frozen time-piece, chronological rupture, 
          a break in continuity. The image schemas issue in figural patterns whose 
          dynamic effect is to enlist and express the image schema of vertical 
          mobility. Each of the three divergent discursive formations shelters 
          this dynamic figural set, or figural formation.</p>
        <p>It is a further hypothesis of this study that this figural formation 
          is dependent on the textual representation of a problematic in the relation 
          between the body and the mind. A rift in personal or corporeal integrity 
          occurs; figuration ascribes positive or negative value to the rift-positive 
          valuation indexes the rift as liberational while negative valuation 
          indexes it as oppressive. At stake are the subjective boundaries of 
          consciousness and of its corporeal habitation, which may be indexed 
          as permeable, and as permeable, vulnerable to (in the negative valuation) 
          or capable of (in the positive valuation) conflation with a second subjectivity. 
          The permeability of&#151;&quot;Hey! What is this?&quot;</p>
        <p><i>&quot;The Introduction,&quot; said Method.<br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Well, tone it down already!&quot; cried Doubt, &quot;Who do 
          you think you're talking to anyway?&quot; Intuition's ears were always 
          trained to certain frequencies. &quot;Tone it down, hmmmm. Method, don't 
          talk so loud, for shame.&quot; &quot;That's not what I mean!&quot; cried 
          Doubt. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Method calmly. &quot;What's 
          with all this high falutination?&quot; Intuition controlled its glee. 
          &quot;Doubt might be referring to diction. Elevated diction?&quot; Doubt 
          made a noise like assent. &quot;High words, even? Up Words?&quot; Intuition 
          pressed its point.</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;I get it already, but come on.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Look,&quot; said stern Method. &quot;Some of the ideas in 
          here are complicated.&quot; &quot;I can do complicated,&quot; said Doubt 
          &quot;but does complicated have to mean high words?&quot; Method, not 
          wishing to offend, asserted gently, &quot;Sometimes it does, but I will 
          try to keep the high words at a minimum. The idea you suggested does 
          not need high words, however.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Hey! Ideas are your job.&quot; Method, also protective of 
          the division of labor, submitted that Doubt had implied an idea: &quot;You 
          assumed a vertical scale of value, power and measurement when you said 
          tone it down, as did Intuition with elevated diction,&quot; said Method. 
          &quot;Elevated diction assumes levels of rhetoric mapped on a vertical 
          scale in which higher is more difficult, and lower is easier&#151;the 
          higher the word, the fewer comprehend. A higher word is like an aristocrat.&quot; 
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;More like a snob,&quot; said Doubt. &quot;Like you, now,&quot; 
          asserted Intuition. &quot;Hey! I'm no snob; I'm against snobbery.&quot; 
          &quot;You're an anti-intellectual snob, though,&quot; said Intuition, 
          &quot;You are anti-high-words, so you are anti-elevated-style, so just 
          maybe you are anti-intellectual, which makes you a low-style snob ascribing 
          higher value to practices that reverse social and rhetorical conventions 
          regarding specialized venues for specialized more abstract and higher 
          theoretical language that refers to the invisible rather than the visible. 
          Is 'up' more value, more complex? or is 'up' more value, simpler, more 
          unity?&quot; <a href="text4.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></i></p>

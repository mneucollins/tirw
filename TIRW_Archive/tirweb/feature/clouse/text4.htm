        <p><i>&quot;I am not a snob.&quot;<br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;You're an anti-intellectual snob,&quot; asserted Intuition, 
          &quot;but I'm not saying that's a bad thing.&quot; <br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;I'm leaving if you're going to call names,&quot; said Doubt, 
          but Method asked everyone to calm down&#151;<br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Calm down? What's up that we should calm down?&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Tempers!&quot; said Method. &quot;Tempers. Calm down, reduce 
          the heat, lower the number of degrees. If Doubt prefers pedestrian to 
          airborne, vulgar to elevated, mundane to lofty, concrete to abstract, 
          we will attempt to abide by that preference.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>Yes, Doubt responded, sense, plain and simple. </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;We will continue then, in a more pedestrian, vulgar, mundane, 
          and concrete style,&quot; said Method. &quot;We will descend from the 
          high rhetoric of abstractions to lowly concretes, from the invisible 
          to the visible. We will go to Intuition's assertions, since they are 
          very concrete and deliver us over to visible things.&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;But hey, if they're my assertions, why can't I talk about 
          them?&quot; lamented Intuition. Doubt, muttering that it was not a snob, 
          was somewhat mollified by the promise of the concrete and asked Intuition 
          if it could be very concrete. Intuition asserted that it could be as 
          concrete as two words. Having already encountered Intuition's One Word, 
          Doubt glowered and began to nurse a grudge. Intuition sensed as much 
          and said it would forego its discussion of 'Assertion (A) On the first 
          page it is best to begin at the top' because the question of vertical 
          scales of power, value, and measurement had already been broached as 
          had its converse, so Intuition said it would begin with 'Assertion (B) 
          I made that up' but&#151;&quot;Hey! You made what up?&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>Method, since Doubt had a point, interpreted: &quot;Doubt is asking 
          for a referent for 'that'.&quot; Intuition protested that that wasn't 
          the first thing. &quot;Well what is the first thing, then?&quot; said 
          Doubt. </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;The basics, at the bottom, so to speak,&quot; said Intuition. 
          </i></p>
        <p><i>Method interjected, &quot;Then you're doing first is at the bottom 
          not first is at the top.&quot; <br>
          </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;That's because,&quot; as though through gritted teeth Intuition 
          said, &quot;First is at the bottom in order even if first is at the 
          top in value, and because, to put it plainly, simply, and in a pedestrian 
          manner that can be understood by inverse rhetorical snobs, I am doing 
          first is at the bottom in order so that I can make things up.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>Doubt barked, &quot;You're making all of this up?&quot; </i><br>
        </p>
        <p><i>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Intuition, &quot;But what you don't 
          know because you won't let me get started is that making something up 
          isn't always the same from Chaucer all the way to</i> Catch-22.&quot;</p>
        <p><i>&quot;You're being oblique and ridiculous,&quot; said Doubt.</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Well just let me start already!&quot; Method stepped in like 
          a stage director: &quot;Intuition will now begin please.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; 
          said Intuition with satisfaction, &quot;I am ready, but I will not supply 
          an antecedent for 'that' at this specific moment because whether or 
          how Assertion (B) refers is part of my introduction.&quot; </i></p>
        <p><i>Doubt pouted out a &quot;Fine&quot; as Intuition launched into an 
          introduction:</i></p>
        <p>(B) I made that up. Here is an assertion with both an overt and covert 
          vertical dimension. There's 'up' right at the end of the sentence. What 
          is it doing there? It isn't acting like an adverb or a preposition; 
          it's acting like part of the verb (it is a verb particle) betraying 
          the Germanic roots of English. Why does make need up? What does this 
          overt up have to do with vertical scales of power, value and measurement? 
          This is the covert part. An earlier interlocutor implied &quot;I made 
          that up&quot; meant I invented something; granted, it can be a way of 
          saying I lied, or, given an antecedent, it can be a response to a question. 
          Mom: What about the bed? Me: I made that up fresh with the new flannel 
          sheets.&quot;</p>
        <p><i>&quot;Intuition does not make up beds,&quot; asserted Doubt. &quot;You 
          haveyour antecedent,&quot; said Intuition, &quot;I did not promise a 
          historical referent; 'that' refers grammatically. I will continue.&quot;</i></p>
        <p>Maybe the literal use of making up the bed, which is a restoring of 
          order, can lead to a question about other figurative uses: Does the 
          making up that is invention also have to do with restoring order? or 
          with restoration more generally?</p>
        <p>&quot;I made that up&quot; is a childhood sentence. Here's a variation 
          that looks like childish redundancy: &quot;I made that up out of my 
          head.&quot; Now the physical seat of invention has been named&#151;the 
          head&#151;and it is at the top. Does invention come out of the head 
          like a thought balloon in a comic strip? Maybe, if &quot;out of&quot; 
          refers to an exit. Does this sentence betray a perception or an experience 
          that somehow the head is permeable so that fiction leaps forth from 
          it, in the direction that is out from the location of the head, which 
          is usually up? Maybe, but &quot;out of&quot; could also refer implicitly 
          to a substance used to produce what is made up, gray matter, used instrumentally, 
          or to thoughts and feelings as material. Picturing &quot;I made that 
          up&quot; as fiction coming out of a head that is perceived to be permeable 
          doesn't really solve the problem of why make needs up, however. </p>
        <p><i>&quot;Maybe, Maybe, Maybe.&quot; Doubt, who did not follow Intuition's 
          lead happily, told it not to indulge in speculations. Method, who anticipated 
          fruits from Intuition's speculations, urged it to continue, but advised 
          it have recourse to an authority. Intuition gladly complied, for an 
          authority would help to ground the discussion in concretes.</i></p>
        <p>Since my purpose at this conference is to enact a bit of genre-bending 
          rather than to introduce my dissertation, I'll spare you the next fifteen 
          pages of conversation among the allegorical constructs who eventually 
          unmask my proper self, the writer, and ask how I expect to compensate 
          readers for the lack of traditional structure, overt argument, footnotes, 
          thesis statements, topic sentences&#151;. My hopeful answer is Pleasure, 
          sometimes Hard Pleasure (Clarice Lispector's ambition becomes my own). 
          What a fine thing it would be if the pleasure of doing it turns over 
          and into the pleasure of reading it, changes into a dear reader's pleasure.

<p>When Ms. Lee asked me to write something about our piece, first called Alternative Autobiographies, I began an explanatory text; but when I asked her for photographs and technical information necessary for a complete essay, nothing came. The draft begun by me languished in my computer for lack of necessary collaborative support. I began to feel that an unremunerative project not important to MIT need not be important to me. When ID/entities came to New York at the Kitchen at the end of November, I felt once again at the opening that the whole transcended any parts; so that whenever anyone complimented me on my piece as their favorite, I replied that the entire exhibition exceeded any of us. Since none of the participating artist' names appeared in the Kitchen's announcement for its show, tiny print falling into ether, I sensed that this second sponsor's impression must have agreed with mine. When the Kitchen closed suddenly for an extended Christmas vacation, contrary to the continuous dates promised in the original announcement, leaving friends and at least one curator visiting New York during that time with nothing of mine to see, I felt that no one can beat guys who close their doors. The lack of not only visible advertisements but also reviews didn't help revive my interest either, as the ID/entities exhibition apparently fell between the categories of standard arts coverage. I even wrote a regular reviewer for a newspaper that had once published me. The reviewer replied that his domain was no longer &quot;digital arts&quot; but &quot;ArtsOnline,&quot; which element was present only in my piece among those in the show. Ever less enthusiastic, I forget to tell friends about the show during the year-end parties and neglected to visit the Kitchen again until well after the New Year began.</p>
<p>Only when I finally returned to ID/entities during its last days did I realize that Ms. Lee's preparation was quite extraordinary: faithful to my purposes in nearly all respects, ambitious in using several projections, and rich in the use of my materials. Into an installation that resembled a writer's study with a desk, typewriter, and a wooden chair next to a simulated window on the left side and a fireplace on the right she cast several kinetic projections of words and only words. Above the fireplace was a rectangular protuberance that resembled a painting's surface. On it were projected at various diagonals key words drawn from my autobiographical texts. Looking like a video loop delivered from an overhead projector, this was actually a sequence of images stored on a computer hard disk.<br>
  </p>
<p>Below it in the face of the fireplace was yet another projection with autobiographical prose passages, all of them horizontally arrayed, overlapping one another as the lines moved up and down the screen. In the larger window, perhaps two feet across by four high, was yet another projection of more words of mine, these arrayed vertically as well as horizontally, some of them drawn from my handwritten book <i>Portraits from Memory</i> (1975). On the top of the desk was a fourth kinetic verbal projection based upon the section &quot;Likes/Dislikes&quot; in another book, <i>Autobiographies</i>(1981).  Onto the typewriter were large horizontal words projected to move upwards continuously, suggesting the charming illusion of words continuously emerging from my typewriter (as they used to do, until I got a computer). The sound effect of typewriter keys tapping contributed to this scene. <a href="inofwords3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

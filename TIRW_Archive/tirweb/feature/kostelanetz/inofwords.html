<p align="left">One of the disadvantages of doing too many things, mostly with minimal financial support, is that you necessarily become sensitive to the enthusiasm of your collaborators. If a publisher of a new book of mine is enthusiastic, I tend to be enthusiastic as well. Conversely, if a collaborator is diffident, I am rarely motivated to transcend him or her, instead devoting my attention to other projects with more remuneration or, in lieu of that, those with more enthusiasm from the sponsor. This dependency upon others seems inevitable, given my professional situation; but those working without position or power don't need to be reminded about lacking leverage in motivating others.</p>
<p>The effects of this unfortunate disadvantage became apparent to me recently when the Media Lab at MIT invited me to participate in an exhibition about ID/entities that they were preparing in the summer of 2001. After a visit to the Lab itself, I realized that there wasn't much for me to do here other than supply prose texts. Whereas previous residencies in audio, video, and holography required my physical participation, this did not. Recent computer technology was beyond me, and no one was prepared to teach me. The fact that MIT didn't plan to pay me anything above reimbursements scarcely lit my fire. When I was asked in advance to reply to emails that would be sent from the exhibition's visitors at a terminal in the installation continuously to my home computer, my first thought was that ID/entities would become an unnecessary waste of precious computer time. (I also erred in referring to Hyun-Yeul Lee as my associate, or even as my technician, as was standards in previous residencies, needlessly dampening her enthusiasm; she was in every sense my collaborator. Only age and alphabetical convenience put my name first.)</p>
<p>When I went to Cambridge for the opening in October, I saw an electronic kinetic display among other similarly high-tech displays, this containing only words of mine. The whole high-tech show was so impressive that I first thought my own piece submerged within the Media Lab's ambitious designs. A piece by Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese, Van Eyck's Mirror, seemed on first viewing the wittiest and thus the strongest. No Boston friends came to the opening, because the Media Lab didn't want to accept my mailing lis, to my discouragement. On the MIT announcement the artists' names appear in tiny print. <a href="inofwords2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

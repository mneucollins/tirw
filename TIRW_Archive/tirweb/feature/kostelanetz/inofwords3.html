<p>On the other side of the typewriter, where the desk met the side wall, was an inkwell and other tools on which yet more words were projected. (This was perhaps the subtlest touch, easily missed.) Moreover, my words in circles were projected down upon an adjacent circular horizontal platform, a few feet in diameter, a few inches off the floor. Given the speed at which the words were moving, they created the illusion that the platform might be spinning. I could see spectators thinking twice before setting their feet upon it. These images too came from a computer. Next to this platform was a waist-high stand with a computer terminal to which spectators were invited to send me messages, as they did (and to which I replied, mostly with witty one-liners, for which I have an evident taste, even at three in the morning). At MIT, this feature worked; in New York, it didn't, I regret to say. To all this kinetic presentation of my language was added a continuous soundtrack drawn mostly from my New York City (1984), an extended electro-acoustic composition of and about the sound of my hometown. (Over my objections Ms. Lee added some 1950s sentimental jazz that always sounded in appropriate to me.) Looking at  the installation more closely, I realized it should have been titled A Life in/of Words. </p>
<p>At perhaps 25 feet by 15, 12 feet high, the installation was thus busy, abundant, enveloping, and awesome in ways that I like my art to be. It couldn't be assimilated quickly, not even by me (who authored all the words). In that respect of requiring time to be understood--more time than even I was able to give it at the two crowded openings--My Life in/of Words resembled an adjacent piece in ID/entities based upon Merce Cunningham's choreography for his hands. It also resembled my holograms which intentionally tried to transcend anything that could be perceived as quickly as most photograph are. </p>
<p>Only after the exhibition closed did I receive a copy of the only review, which apparently appeared only on the Internet, at Wired.com. Written by Noah Shachtman, whom I didn't meet, it identified ours as &quot;the best looking of the installations.&quot; Thanks. &quot;In the apartment's &quot;fireplace&quot; is an orange glow slowly swallowing entries from an autobiographical timeline in yellow and blue. To the left, on a desk, also all white, sits an ancient, black typewriter. A spotlight illuminates the machine, which holds a legal-sized leaf of paper. References to Eliot, Pound and Auden in 72-point type are projected on the page. Synopses of books and records scroll by the right of the typewriter. A garbled pile of projected words spills out of a mock inkwell on the left.&quot; So sharp he is in noticing that last detail, which I thought a crowning touch. Shachtman concludes, &quot;Not even the PC positioned a yard to the left, with the invitation to e-mail Kostelanetz, can spoil the serenity of the scene.&quot; The artist/writer Barbara Pollock, whom I do know, drafted a review that concluded, &quot;Author Richard Kostelanetz's Alternative Autobiographies is an evocative installation in which words, animated and projected,<b> </b>replace the writer.  Using his New York apartment as a theatrical stage set, lines of text dance across the desk, jump in and out of the inkwell, and  rumble across the window in traffic patterns. Poignantly, the author's words also spool out of Smith Corona typewriter, the clicking sounds of the keys a haunting reminder of a recent past now long-gone.&quot;  However, this paragraph disappeared before her review appeared in print. Bad luck on this work, once again. My Life in/of Words also extended to new levels my decades-old interests in both new media for language and experimental autobiography. Taking too long to appreciate it fully, I regretted not recommending it more enthusiastically to friends, possible reviewers, and institutional collectors. Overcoming initial diffidence, I began to love My Life in/of Words so much that I wanted to take it home, but it was too large for any spaces available to me, while the computers weren't mine. I cried when it was torn down. What my friend Peter Andros did retrieve was parts of the setting (that could be rebuilt) along with the kinetic verbal images on digital bits, while Eric Solstein took some videotape of it to incorporate into a video portrait he is planning to do of me as a writer, all with the hope that My Life in/of Words will someday soon be reconstituted. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

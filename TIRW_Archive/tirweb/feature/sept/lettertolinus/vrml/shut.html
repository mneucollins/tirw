      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond"><img src="../images/shut.gif" width="132" height="132" align="left">Because 
        you need it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Why have police asked the public to turn 
        in their books? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Easy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Because language is the most powerful 
        tool in the world. Dissidents and terrorists would be powerless to organize 
        without it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">And it's a tool you can't live without.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">And that's why we're Linguatech, the 
        aggressive young company that patented language. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Language can now be licensed exclusively 
        through us. Our English is state-of-the-art, upgraded every year. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">And we have products to meet every budget, 
        including share-words: this month we're giving away Esperanto for free. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">The art of writing has always been threatened 
        by low overhead. Until now. When you join our exclusive club, you'll enjoy 
        the benefits of reduced competition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">And our language is secure, thanks to 
        encryption. So nobody will read your writing unless they have the key. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Because protecting your property, and 
        ours, is important to us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Our revolutionary business model has 
        attracted its share of critics, who claim that proprietary language is 
        bad for language, that an obsolete tongue with competing dialects is superior 
        to one developed by a handful of professional linguists working in private 
        sessions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">But we say: some things are too important 
        to be entrusted to just everybody. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">So, if you're serious about writing, 
        don't write graffiti. License literacy today. And shut</font></p>

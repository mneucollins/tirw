      <p><img src="../images/../images/blow.gif" width="132" height="132" align="left"><font face="Palatino, Garamond">if 
        you ask me... I'm not saying that the world is a construct of your mind. 
        I'm saying the opposite: the world exists. Your mind is a construct of 
        the world. Your imagination is an illusion...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">I can't hear you. There's too much machine 
        gun fire outside. Hold on a second...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">That's better. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">No, I can't close the window, the glass 
        is shattered, I taped a newspaper over it to block out the noise... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Newspapers these days have a unique property: 
        they absorb all information such that none can escape...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Actually I'm unemployed, but working 
        on getting hired as a poet... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">My parents, before they died, bought 
        me English as a graduation present. It's an outdated version. I hear it 
        has fewer problems than the latest release, but I can't look up some of 
        the newer words...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Recent poetry a friend pirated for me...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">No, to be honest, I didn't do well in 
        college as a poet. But when I heard there was a propaganda campaign to 
        quell a populist uprising, I started sending a poem a day to the Pentagon...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond"> Yes, absolutely the best job I can imagine. 
        I'd love to be published in midair like that... But you have to be good. 
        You need to write lines of steel to bend the reader to your uncontestable 
        imagery... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Dropping fire, exactly....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Well, I'm pretty determined to keep writing, 
        as long as there's a potential enemy somewhere...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Linus? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Oh, he did? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Wow, they dropped his poems on <i>Manhattan?</i> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">No...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Can't go out dancing tonight, I'm writing, 
        but thanks...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond"> The literati of Harlem or Watts or Detroit 
        gazing at the sky listening to a screaming bomb fall on them. And when 
        it hits, and they are braced for the explosion that could kill them, there 
        is only a quiet rustling of paper, and poetry streaming from the sky like 
        tickertape... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Garamond">Yeah, but it will take more than poetry 
        to blow</font></p>

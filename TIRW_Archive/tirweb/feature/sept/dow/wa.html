        t</font></font><font size="+1">he <a href="sb.html">secretary</a> glanced 
        up at Johnny Werd's appearance in the doorway. Werd was kind of tall and 
        handsome behind his round spectacles. His red hair rose in a smooth pompadour, 
        like a gleaming fender. His cotton suit hung from his tall frame, slouched 
        in the doorway. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">The secretary asked "do you like jazz?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd had been at this company for a few 
        weeks and he knew from painful experience not to let Simon back him into 
        a corner first thing in the morning.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd blinked and came back at him like a 
        cornered badger:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">"Well what kind of jazz are we talking here? 
        There's all kind of jazz. Solo vocal combo, Big band, bebop acidjazz, 
        forties fifties sixties seventies eighties nineties, we got in jazz out 
        jazz and way out jazz. And you got your standards. I mean, can you clarify 
        the question? Otherwise I don't think I can answer it. Sorry."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd walked swiftly through the lobby, waving 
        away Simon's response, and passed safely into the interior of the building. 
        He blinked and caught his breath and thought the word "coffee" and looked 
        down a very long corridor. At the end of the corridor the Administrator 
        passed nervously across the hall from one room into another. Even at this 
        great distance it was obvious from the intensity of her velocity that 
        the Administrator was extremely nervous about something. In that instant 
        and at that distance the Administrator was fractal, every movement swift 
        and inefficient, crawling with anxiety, all over the map, scattershot, 
        creating effectiveness through overextended effort. Adrenaline with a 
        smattering of accuracy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd moved quickly up the corridor and turned 
        left at the door into the coffeeroom. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">It was bad, it left a pitiful taste, as 
        if a mouse had crawled into one's mouth and died, and eventually an aching 
        dehydrated hollow constricted pain in the chest, and he drank it out of 
        styrofoam, which was nonbiodegradable and released ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons 
        into the atmosphere. And he needed it worse than a blind newborn kitten 
        needed a teat, and his groping was just as inept but persistent.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Coffee. Very good. Yes.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Time, then, to confront the Administrator 
        and prepare the training tapes for the new Carbide chemists who were being 
        reassigned to the Ziploc assembly line. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Then to the boardroom and the meeting with 
        the confused technicians who had had trouble with their English ever since 
        mastering Java. Then onto the powerpoint presentation in the cafeteria. 
        After that perhaps a twenty-minute exodus for lunch, to eat a hot dog 
        standing up on a busy sidewalk. And then there would be a reprieve for 
        the checking of the email, which would likely flower into a magnificent 
        bloom of additional work. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">And then, and then...</font> <font color="#000000">

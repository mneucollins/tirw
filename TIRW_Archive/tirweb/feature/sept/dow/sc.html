      <p><font size="+1">Simon tumbled through frames, shapes changed shape, and 
        words blinked into and out of existence. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">He was aware that his brain was changing. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Somehow, without being able to leave this house, he could 
        tell the paint on the outside was peeling. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">He knew that his memory was dissolving and he wasn't 
        sure how much longer he would be able to remember that he was losing his 
        memory. He couldn't remember when he first noticed it, but he was pretty 
        sure the job that was causing it. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">And then he remembered why he had come in to work so 
        early. Because he had come to some understanding that weapons research 
        was being done here, and he had wanted to look for clues on the computer 
        while the building was nearly empty. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Somehow he had ended up looking at pornography instead. 
        How had he gone from weapons development to pornography? He tried to retrace 
        his steps through the fog and dissonance. Nowhere. No steps. He wandered 
        off on a new tangent that didn't intersect his previous tangent. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">How was it possible for him to be aware of his inability 
        to concentrate? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">How long would it last?</font> </p>
      <p><font size="+1">He needed to write a letter to himself, he decided, and 
        put it in the mail. In a few days he would receive it and know, if he 
        couldn't remember having sent it, that he was losing his mind. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Moving quickly, the idea already fading, he opened the 
        word-processor and began.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Afraid that by the time he reached the end of the letter 
        he would have come derailed and would no longer remember what he was writing, 
        he entitled it:</font></p>

              fulltime at a computer building webpages and getting constant exposure 
              to the Internet is shaping my mind badly, melting those walls that 
              channel consciousness, turning me into some whimsical inept parody 
              of my former self, where distorted impulses arise from an inaccessible 
              personality and I am swayed by them seemingly at random. </font></p>

              I forget?</font></p>

            <p><font size="+1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">It is a degenerative 
              disorder of horrible magnitude. I am stumbling madly along the ruts 
              at the border of the city where I once thought. It's skyscrapers 
              are distant and mist-shrouded. I cannot follow the course of the 
              disease that makes me forget the disease that makes me forget. It's 
              streets are a strange hall of mirrors to me now. A landscape I once 
              knew in detail is a bewildering funhouse.</font></p>

        return-addressed it with the same address, put a stamp on it, put it in 
        the mail, and, with alacrity and poise, moved to clean the coffeepot.</font></p>

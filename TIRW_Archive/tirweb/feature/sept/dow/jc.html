      city stretched beneath them. Jerome took the J from Brad and looked at it 
      absently. The uncoiling smoke twisted and flattened in the wind that poured 
      across the top of the skyscraper where they stood against the sky. </font> 
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">Jerome put the J to his 
        lips. Then, his heart pounding in his ears, he looked out at the saturated 
        blue sky, cloudless deep blue, put the J back to his lips sucked in and 
        coughed horribly. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">Brad winced at the bronchial 
        depth of Jerome's cough.</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;You're sick, man.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;You're fucking right 
        I am. From working in the weapons factory, that's why. Who knows what 
        toxins it's my job to wring out of a mop each night.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Each night?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Well. As you know, 
        I've worked out an arrangement with my colleagues where we punch each 
        other in, so we each only end up working a couple nights each week. We 
        get paid for five. But still, two or three nights a week in there is enough 
        to make my hands and wrists change color.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;You're kidding.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Am not. Look.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;So you blow off work 
        most of the week and nobody catches on?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Yeah. They treat us 
        real well over there. For some reason. They go real easy on us and pay 
        us pretty good. Except no health insurance. Otherwise, it's kind of a 
        cakewalk. For a janitor gig anyway. It definitely helps that at a fairly 
        deep level I don't care whether those labs get cleaned up spotless like 
        they expect. Let those chemical company bastards work in the poison they 
        create, I say. One night I blew off work and ended up drinking at the 
        same bar as an Administrator. She never caught on. You were serving us 
        man. Remember?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">Brad shook his head in 
        disbelief. Jerome, hands on the roofrail, gazed to the east and watched 
        the sun set reflected in a mirrored skyscraper, orange light pooling in 
        the windowframes as liquid fire. </font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Weapons factory? 
        You guys still making Napalm and Agent Orange then?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Oh, if only things 
        were so simple. The innocence of bygone days. Violins and shit. Napalm. 
        That's like baby food, man.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Have you seen that 
        photo ... of the Vietnamese girl..?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Seen it? It's in my 
        locker at work. Pass that, hey.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Here. So what you 
        guys building over there?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Psh. They won't tell 
        me. </font><font size="+1" color="#000000">But I pay attention. I clean 
        offices at night. I see things.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;You see things.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;This and that. Last 
        night I saw a drawing on a bar napkin. A drawing of like, the world blowing 
        up.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Oh. Was it a napkin 
        from the bar I work at?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Yeah, matter of fact 
        it was.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;I saw the kid who 
        drew that. Orange hair. Glasses. Sits alone. Talks constantly when he's 
        drunk. Constantly.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;I seen him. He's a 
        temp worker I think. Here for the takeover. To train Carbide people. Makes 
        videos.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Yeah. That's what 
        the napkin was for. A video. Like a storyboard. He was telling me all 
        about it. Safety video. Big concept. Like some worker spills dioxin in 
        the lap and it kills a butterfly in China. Very heavy. He was reaching. 
        The asshole.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Oh.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="right"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Hey man <a href="ba.html">I 
        gotta go open the bar</a>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000">&quot;Yeah I should drop 
        by work and make sure I punched in today. I'll see you in an hour or so.&quot;</font>

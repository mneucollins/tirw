        <font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1"> jukebox throbbed in anguish in 
        the corner. And there was a payphone. There were darts and a misleading 
        sense of activity. There was a newspaper rack. There were cigarettes. 
        There was a mirror, bottles, tables, a rail, coasters, cocktail napkins, 
        condiments, the smell of grilled onions, restrooms, darkness, warmth, 
        smoke. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">The News took a seat at the bar next to 
        its friend the Snow. The Snow had travelled here to spend the weekend 
        with the News and their friend the Heat, who had not yet arrived. They 
        all liked to get together every now and then to drink, tell stories, and 
        plan future blizzards and heatwaves. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">The Snow ordered the News a gin and tonic. 
        For now they sat there not saying much, watching the game. It had been 
        an exhausting year for both of them, what with the Snow creating danger 
        and accidents across the midwest, and the News reporting it. To say nothing 
        of the heatwave, noteworthy for the large number of lives lost.</font></p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p><font size="+1"> But the blizzard had been spectacular. The President, 
          during this whiteout of the News by snow stories, had pledged the military 
          more money than they had ever had. It made both of them a little excited&#151;the 
          News and the Snow&#151;and there was no chance to think about it. The 
          News had had to make a quick trip to Afghanistan for an exclusive interview 
          with Osama Bin Laden after that had happened, and hadn't yet had a chance 
          to congratulate the Snow on its fine show in January.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> Then, at last, their old friend the Military walked 
          in the door and took his hat off and took a seat at the bar beside them. 
          The News and the Military were very close friends. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">The Military ordered a round. The Military usually 
          payed about a million dollars for a pint of beer, or a billion for a 
          mixed drink. The drinks were mixed by powerful computers and served 
          in an aluminum snifter sealed with a special coating. The News had another 
          gin and tonic. The Snow had a brandy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">They always enjoyed their discussions. Whenever they 
          got to talking about future blizzards and heatwaves, the Military always 
          had an opinion. Timing was crucial, the Military believed, and the others 
          all liked to listen to his ideas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> </font><font size="+1">There was a lone typist in 
          the corner wringing out pages, the clatter of the typewriter lost amidst 
          the terrible loud rock and the conversations people had, voices wandering 
          lost in the din.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> </font><font size="+1">Johnny <a href="wb.html">Werd</a> 
          walked in and took a seat at the bar. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">The Military turned to the News and said, confidentially: 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> &quot;<a href="tc.html">Terrorism</a>.&quot;</font></p>

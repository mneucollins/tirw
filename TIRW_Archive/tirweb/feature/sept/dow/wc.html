        times always astonished Johnny Werd. Through his second gin and tonic 
        he might cast a gaze up at the parrots in the cage over the bar and say 
        &quot;The cruelty of the 20th Century is too much for a sane mind to fathom, 
        so it's hard to blame people who don't seem to care.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Having said this he might solemnly suck 
        the cocktail onion off the end of the yellow plastic sword, or maybe there 
        would be the sigh of a match and the lighting of another menthol cigarette. 
        He might gesture, sweeping his arm, palm upturned, across the front of 
        the <i>Wall Street Tribune</i> as it lay draped across a barstool, as 
        if its front page said it all. And perhaps for Werd it did. </font></p>
      <div align="left">
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">But the topic of the times would now be 
          closed for the remainder of the evening. Eventually, even the bar would 
          close, but until then Werd would talk only about work. Werd worked developing 
          training programs for corporations. He worked mostly on the production 
          of videos. When working for a client, he would spend weeks on site, 
          so he traveled frequently. This month he was in Midland where he commuted 
          in a daily cycle between a room at the Velour Hotel, the corporate headquarters 
          of Dow, and the bar. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Another, he waves. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">The bartender understands that Werd will 
          be ordering a different drink each time. And he understands that this 
          scrawny man with the wiry red hair and the round spectacles will be 
          difficult and attempt to throw him for a loop. This time it will be 
          absinthe or an Income Tax Cocktail. The bartender walks off, unaffected, 
          to search for vermouth and bitters. Werd is struck, now, with an idea 
          for a video he's working on, that instructs Dow Managers on how to fire 
          newly-bought employees. </font></p>

          I mean I'm gonna be thirty in a month, I got nothing to show but a lousy 
          job, and a closetful of manuscripts. I got everything I need to buckle 
          down, I mean really buckle down, plan out the next ten years, make lists 
          and execute them ya know. Figure out what I'm doing with ym life. I 
          mean, jeez, this hotel room I got&#151;top floor, no AC&#151;hotter 
          than hell up there Johnny. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I gotta focus. I can't focus. The heat 
          and this damn numbing job. You ever worked for a transnational Johnny? 
          They fly you places. At first it seems romantic. At first. Helping secure 
          capital and all. Then you look back at who you were but the door's locked. 
          There's bars on the window. You expand your credit, get fat, and then 
          you can't move anymore. You gather moss and investments and assets and 
          you buy things, they get more expensive and less fun, tossing off cash. 
          It's like falling in love too many times, Johnny, you ever fallen in 
          love too many times?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I gotta figure out a way out, Johnny, 
          I gotta get back. But I can't get back.</font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">It's gonna be Y2K soon, everything's gonna 
          change. You ever think about&#151;huh? Yeah, I'll take another, gimme 
          a, uh..., can you mix me an International Incident Johnny. It's in the 
          book. Yeah. Thanks. Y2K. everything's gonna change. I'm sitting here 
          at this bar in this big highrise, and there's neon on the glass and 
          a cyberjuice espresso bar downstairs, but I might as well be sitting 
          here in a fedora, and this might as well be like, an art-deco joint 
          from Berlin in the 30's. You see? This is going to be old-fashioned. 
          And quaint. And next year I'm going to be an anachronistic 30-year-old 
          moving like an ashen ghost through a transformed world. A world of hyperviolent 
          Woodstock concerts and full-scale military assaults against obscure 
          countries that aren't our enemy. A world of killing and fabulous computers. 
          There's a noose tightening around the population&#151;the wealth gap&#151;it's 
          a razorwire garrote that's going to sever us into two species, and those 
          two species are going to be at war. But not for extermination or submission 
          or acquisition. It will be a war of domination. A few frail giants will 
          walk across the hardened shells of the rest of us, and we'll be crunching 
          like cockroach exoskeletons underfoot. We're going back to slavery, 
          and it's going to have a brand new name. </font></p>

          Not: Strength, peace, freedom.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Ever read Orwell, Johnny? Ever read Marx? 
          It's one of those crazy things. Like a particular form of insanity: 
          sanity. I pick up a bottle like this, see, oh, hey, sorry guy I wasn't 
          trying to take your beer I was just demonstrating, so I pick up, uh, 
          an empty bottle over here and I see clearly the fingerprints. I see 
          the people slaving in the heat of the brewery, their union busted. I 
          see their children's scars. I see migrant workers moving across a field 
          of hops while pesticide rains from above. I see minimum wage and less. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I tell you: you read that shit and it 
          wrecks you. Like a virus of the mind. Like God or truth. I don't have 
          a family Johnny. Because, well, mostly because nobody loves me, but 
          also because I see the family as a fiction. The family is supposed to 
          take care of you and teach you morality so that the state doesn't have 
          to provide for those who can't make it. I get so lonely sometimes Johnny 
          in that hotel room that I'll program three movies in a row. I was watching 
          David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, some Coen brothers. Natural-Born Killers, 
          Silence of the Lambs. Hyperviolent art movies of the nineties. A new 
          theatrical experience freed of good guys, if you get me. A world without 
          redemption or heroes or love, just killers who fascinate and mesmerize 
          us in their unflinching viciousness. What a sick fucking country this 
          is. This is our art, and it doesn't resemble art. Oh sure, it's beautiful 
          and hypnotic but it has no flesh - it has scales, it isn't human. Np 
          motivation toward an improved world, nothing sustainable.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I used to think maybe I was an asshole, 
          or clinically depressed, or maniacally introverted, because I hated 
          parties and would rather stay home. Write novels to put in a drawer. 
          Parties, with their suspended motivation. Like a psychological vacuum, 
          an ether, in which one drifts into the bliss of a moderate amount of 
          alcohol. Like a swimmingpool on a hot day, you go in and are refreshed 
          by the clarity of the cool water, glittering and amniotic, relaxed by 
          the exertion required for slow movement. And you don't think about... 
          books... or computers... while you're in there, Johnny, because that 
          shit ain't waterproof. And you're in the pool with a lot of people, 
          maybe total strangers, and you're all almost naked and wet, and it isn't 
          awkward at all. it's comfortable. Very comfortable.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I like swimming, Johnny, but I like to 
          swim laps, swim underwater, go off the diving board. I like to swim 
          in a direction.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">What... Brad. Right. Brad not Johnny. 
          Johnny is my name. Sorry Brad. Man, how embarrassing. Well, I guess 
          you must get a lot of people in here forgetting your name. Oh. </font><font size="+1">Not 
          really, huh. Well.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Well, I read this book the other day and 
          now I know. I don't have a good time at parties. and it's not because 
          I'm an asshole- what? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Well, maybe I am an asshole, that's not 
          my point, my point- </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Asshole, yeah.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Why you want to go and say a thing like 
          that <a href="bb.html">Brad</a>? Asshole. Fine. Get me another Sino-Soviet 
          Split it's in the book. Jeez. Make yourself useful, seeing as how you 
          aren't going to listen my troubles. Where'd you learn to tend bar anyway?

      <p align="left"><font size="+1">One hand loosening his bowtie, Werd sat 
        in the darkening room and stared out into the indigo evening, watching 
        lamps come on in the park, on the street, and in the other buildings. 
        He had another cigarette and slid the window open, permitting a cool breeze. 
        The evening had opened up to him. The sky was pure and cloudless. There 
        was a moon. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">The phone rang. He let the machine get it. 
        The machine was turned down so he couldn't hear who it was. The machine 
        stopped taking the message and rewound itself. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Time stumbled down the street fifteen floors 
        down taking occasional sips from a brown paper bag.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">What was it about Werd that might offer 
        us a clue? In his hotel room, where he now sleeps in the chair, cigarette 
        butt extending in a skeletal finger of ash from between his fingers, there 
        is little that will tell us who he his. There is a briefcase. Inside it 
        is all corporate bullshit that makes no sense to us. And there is no nostalgia 
        there, the briefcase may well have been mass-produced, with the contents 
        in it. Let's move on to the suitcase. A number of identical blue suits, 
        shirts, ties, socks, and the underwear. Paisley boxers. Well that at least 
        is a sign of something. Yes. Aside from that, the only other clues to 
        Werd in this hotel room are that the last channel he watched on TV was 
        Cinemax, and the only part of the <i>Bible</i> he has read is the word 
        &quot;Bible&quot; embossed gold on the green cover. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">There is no Werd here.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">He is dreaming but even his dreams, like 
        his salary, could have been predicted by someone who knew the time and 
        place of his birth. </font> <font color="#000000"> </font></p>

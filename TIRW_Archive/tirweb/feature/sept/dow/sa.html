        <p><font size="+1">Flagrant waste, Simon thought, looking at the text 
          it was his job to edit, clean up and mark up. Prose in no way lucid, 
          reams of paragraphs of throat-clearing. Devoid of candor, all of it 
          legalese or long grant-proposal dialect. Stifled expression crept through 
          in myriad formatting tics and quirks, wanton fonts, salient words and 
          points emphasized in a variety of fashions: italics, bold, underlined, 
          and sans-serif. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Simon sighed. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1"><i>Yes, but is it art?</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"><i>No, clearly not.</i> </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">But he could not prove it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Something was melting his mind. He wondered whether 
          it was the Internet.</font> </p>
        </div>
      <div align="left"></div>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p><font size="+1">The vicissitude of his secretary position&#151;his 
          first full-time job&#151;was sanding him down. Here, a project could 
          go from being a looming priority to being forgotten unfinished forever 
          in less than a day. The sense that most of what he accomplished would 
          be wasted injected a numb stupidity into every decision, cast a pall 
          of emptiness into everything. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">This windowless reception area had become a cocoon 
          in which he was undergoing a metamorphosis. Simon could tell that, after 
          taking this job out of desperation, his once-anchored opinions had begun 
          to shift and dissolve like a sort of vague, didactic static. And now 
          he could no longer seem to hold an idea in mind for any duration of 
          time. Bricks faded into shadows then air. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">So, understanding that his mind was going, Simon kept 
          a notebook in which he wrote down everything that seemed important whenever 
          it occurred to him. Whether it was an idea for a ballet, or a note to 
          stop at the stationary store on the way home after work, he wrote it 
          down. For weeks this had been going on. He couldn't understand where 
          all these ideas were coming from when his life had been given over to 
          a full-time creativity-dissolving environment. He reasoned that perhaps 
          he had always had ideas, but previously had acted on them. Now they 
          just buzzed around his head. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">His whole mind it seemed was floating, irrelevant, 
          a sort of vanity. He might make it to the stationary store, but would 
          never write that ballet. In this manner his mind seemed to have disconnected 
          from his body, severed from within, and his interior life, with all 
          its daring adventure and fabulous aesthetics, lived on in isolation 
          while the body woke up every morning at precisely 6 AM and cleaned itself 
          and got on the train to go to work.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">As the train rattled on elevated racks past an abandoned 
          carnival that morning, a man below <a href="ja.html">splattered vomit 
          on the wall</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="+1">Train. Was it <a href="sb.html">lunch 
          hour</a>, or... was the day over?</font></p>

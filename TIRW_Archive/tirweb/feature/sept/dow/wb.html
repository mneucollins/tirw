        come into the breakroom, it's Agnes' birthday. We're having a little lunch. 
        I made Sloppy Joes."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Johnny Werd stared up at the secretary and 
        stammered, his mind unable to fix upon an excuse. He had been lost in 
        concentration, staring at the <i>Dow Janitorial Training Manual,</i> trying 
        to decipher an informational diagram which, through several illustrations 
        with circles and arrows, demonstrated how to wring out a mop. Werd's face 
        went blank and pale, his mouth open, looking up at the secretary who looked 
        down at him steadily.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">He swallowed. "Be right there." And he managed 
        a weak smile as a sort of punctuation.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">In the break room the atmosphere was festive 
        but limp, like a wet pi&#241ata. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd spooned a scoop of wet meat onto a 
        white bun on a paperplate. He sat in a corner. Gladys referred to him 
        as "the token male" with an edge almost of malice. Werd smiled emptily. 
        Chatter perpetuated. A photograph of newborn baby was passed around. They 
        laughed at his reaction. Like a man's. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd, eviscerated, stumbled down the corridor 
        to his office. On the way he thought about <a href="tb.html">the News</a>, 
        and the Dupont bombing. He wondered whether the air was safe.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">He remembered a chemistry experiment he 
        had attempted as a child. That childhood world he had destroyed himself 
        with a pale indelible flame while experimenting. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd entered his office and, unable to sit, 
        looked out the window. He saw a tree with slender branches bending under 
        the weight of a squirrel.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">He moved closer to the window.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"> Two floors beneath him, a babycarriage 
        rolled along the crowded sidewalk unaccompanied. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd's breath seized and his heart screamed. 
        He blinked hard and challenged reality. <i>Am I seeing things?</i> He 
        looked up the street the direction the carriage had come from. He saw 
        a woman struggling with a man. He looked downhill, and saw the hill get 
        steeper. The carriage moved between people, people in hats and raincoats 
        with shoppingbags, some of them stepping aside to avoid it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">As Werd sprinted out the door of his office, 
        his pencil fell onto the training manual, rolled down one of the pages, 
        across the table, off the edge of the table, and fell, turning about 90 
        degrees of arc to stick point-down in the orange carpet.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Werd burst out the fire exit onto the crowded 
        streetlevel. He had lost his perspective and could no longer see the baby 
        carriage. He took two steps in the direction his instincts screamed that 
        he should go in. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">And stopped, staring helplessly into the 
        indifferent train of passersby.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><a href="wc.html">Then he walked the other 
        way </a>.</font> </p>

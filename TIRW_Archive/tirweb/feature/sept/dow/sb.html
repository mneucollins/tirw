        thought about the <a href="sc.html">morning</a> and how he couldn't remember 
        it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="+1">He wondered whether his refusal to remember the future 
        was causing him to black out the past, in order to force himself to deal 
        with the future. Then he forgot what he had just thought.</font></p>
      <div align="left">

          over.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Simon admired Werd, considered him doctrinaire, rootless, 
          a man of the world with the uncanny ability to make a solid living doing 
          work that was not only of benefit only to corporations, but was in fact 
          incomprehensible outside the corporate world, with no useful application 
          in any human domain save business. What kind of mind could lose itself 
          that way, and, severed, float above, disconnected from the urges of 
          the spirit?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Simon had been using the Internet to track the progress 
          of the poisons dispersed by the bombed Dupont factory. </font><font size="+1">And 
          to check to see if any new groups had claimed responsibility for the 
          bombing. The power of the Internet had made it possible for anyone who 
          wanted to to claim responsibility, and the news sought out each confession. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">It seemed as though the country were populated by terrorists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">And then Simon paused, feeling that he had just forgotten 
          something.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">He entered his name into a search engine and tapped 
          Enter quizzically. The machine paused at its chore and, uncertain, Simon 
          compared the spelling he had typed into the machine to the spelling 
          on his desk's nameplate. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">His obituary came up. He read the story:</font></p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <div align="left">
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Simon Blanc was one of the 
            first to die from inhaling the toxins released by the blast caused 
            by the terrorist explosion in the Dupont factory today. Terrorism 
            is on the rise. The President has doubled the Military's budget. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">Simon tried to remember <a href="sc.html">the morning</a>. 
          Perhaps he had indeed been poisoned and was in a state of deep shock. 
          That might explain his inability to understand the sequence of events.</font></p>

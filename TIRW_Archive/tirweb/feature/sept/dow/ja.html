        <font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">here is this? A widening parallelogram 
        of sun rises on the living room. Its bright finger begins a slow investigation 
        of the wooden floor. It climbs the side of a beer bottle used as an ashtray 
        and grows longer and slides over the bottle and sweeps across a Robyn 
        Hitchcock tape on the floor, a three-by-five card someone has typed something 
        on, a potted plant. Sunlight rolls over the toe of a mannequin with a 
        sombrero and plastic sunglasses. The radio comes on. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last night at midnight 
          a bomb went off at the headquarters of Dow Corning. The building was 
          destroyed, spewing poisonous chemicals into the atmosphere. Citizens 
          are advised to stay indoors and to be alert for symptoms of poisoning 
          including nausea dizziness shortness of breath. More after this. A Marxist 
          group, an eco-feminist group, and the Brotherhood of Custodians have 
          each separately claimed responsibility for the incident. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="+1">Jerome awakens into a burning anxiety. His 
        personality returns in a blur of fragments. He crushes the goosedown pillow 
        against the wall and leans up and blinks. His sleep had been an asphyxiating, 
        dreamless, blank unconsciousness. A wretched cognizance overcomes him 
        as he stares unblinking at the wall stained by feeble fogfiltered morning 
        light.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">The day has begun, the sky is grey. The 
        weather hangs like wool, as still and irritating. The curtains move gently 
        in the draft streaming in through the ruined window. </font></p>

        stands up, staggers to the bathroom, and hurls repeatedly. </font><font size="+1">With 
        a gasp the chunks pour out, shaken loose. Chunks of what, he wonders dizzily, 
        negotiating spasms. He hasn't eaten.</font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font size="+1">He stumbles outdoors into the ruins of cinderblocks 
        and a rust eaten Weber grill, past an abandoned hot dog truck on bricks, 
        a spent condom among beercans. Picking shreds of regurgitation from between 
        his teeth using the pinky of his cigarette hand, he walks.</font></p>

      <div align="left">
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I polish the bottles. I am death. I distribute 
          poison to those who would pay to swallow it, and they leave a tip for 
          their assassin. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">From outside it appears as if everything 
          is spontaneous. A great event is happening in this bar. All these people 
          have gathered here by coincidence, to enjoy a spectacular new sense 
          of themselves. They chose to come here and they chose what to drink, 
          or so they think.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Actually the poison is in control. The 
          poison is all around us, in the bottles of whiskey and in the bottles 
          of bleach used to scrub the vomit from the bathroom tiles. It is in 
          the contents of the bottles and it is in the plastic the bottles are 
          made of. The poison seeps out from the floorboards, rubs two tendrils 
          together, and reaches into the pockets. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">It would appear that a lot of people are 
          having a good time, but they are puppets of the poison.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">Even that janitor, that tolerable janitor, 
          is not a being. He is a ring wiggling on the poison's finger. He works 
          close to the core of things, where the poison is created, its acids 
          burning a hole in time, a hole the money flows into as if a whirlpool.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">You see, the poison is not in control. 
          The money is trying to kill us. Through poison, war, weapons, strife 
          created by the money's concentration in the hands of its conscripts 
          the rich.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">This bar has been open as long as Dow. 
          The trickle of its employees has sustained us when our business would 
          otherwise have failed. When the Chevrolet plant closed, and Don the 
          best dart player in Michigan left for Decatur to find work, still the 
          Dow people came. When the brewery burned down, and Mike who knew every 
          score of every Pistons game since 1970 killed himself, still came the 
          Dow people.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1">I hate them.</font> </p>

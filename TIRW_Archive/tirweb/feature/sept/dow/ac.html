        seemed annoyed. Was it because he had already put away the Kahlua?</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Annabel had worked all day long. She had had a heart-to-heart 
        with Simon which had made her feel better about things. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Work had been slow and difficult. The incident with Dow 
        Corning had caused a lot of meetings about security, and those meetings 
        had taken up most of her day. In fact, she thought bemusedly, a terrorist 
        could have planted a bomb under her desk during her normal office hours, 
        because she had been in the conferenceroom all day.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">She wanted to tell Brad this. She thought he would get 
        a kick out of it, in his own impassive fashion. But something was bothering 
        him. He hadn't even poured her drink, he had just set the Kahlua and Smirnov 
        on the bar with a glass and had walked off to mop.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Brad was acting strange.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000">Annabel wondered if she should ask him 
        what was bothering him. But that would have been ridiculous: like if a 
        waiter came up to your table and you asked him if he needed anything.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000">She poured herself another, feeling helpless 
        about the proportions. It was all wrong, but she drank it and stared up 
        at the TV. It had the sound turned down. It looked like an old movie, 
        or the news. There were flames pouring out of a building and billowing 
        black clouds.</font></p>

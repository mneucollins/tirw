        walks past a dilapidated carnival, boarded up. Shattered funhouse mirrors 
        whose silvered paint is flaking lean against a squat brick catacomb. A 
        globular plastic clown head with a shattered nose offers a gap-toothed 
        grin exposing old wiring stripped of components. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Jerome is momentarily overcome and leans against a wall 
        gasping. When it subsides he puts a cigarette in his mouth and pushes 
        himself again to his feet. Across the street a junkyard dog with maniacal 
        energy paces the razorwire-crennelated perimeter of a cemetary littered 
        with husks of doomed automobiles.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Jerome pauses at a warehouse door. He does not knock. 
        The door is opened by a gigantic man wearing a pinstripe suit and garish 
        clown makeup, red nose, shoes, and silk tie. A large red tear flows from 
        the man's eye.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Upstairs <a href="ta.html">the Terrorist</a> sits alone 
        at a table before a row of intermittently-shattered windows that overlook 
        a ruined ferris wheel seeming to lean in the breeze.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">The Terrorist nods and gestures at a stool. Jerome shakes 
        the Terrorist's hand and sits. Jerome removes his backpack from his back 
        and removes from it an envelope which he puts on the table. The Terrorist 
        smiles a missing tooth. The Terrorist gestures at a pack of cigarettes 
        and picks up the envelope. Jerome pats the cigarette package in his breast 
        pocket as if to say no.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">From the envelope the Terrorist withdraws a key and a 
        folded map. The Terrorist unfolds the map and examines it, inspecting 
        its markings. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">The Terrorist nods, pockets the map and key, and nods 
        to the large clown in the suit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">The clown comes out of the shadows and hands Jerome a 
        duffel bag.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Jerome accepts the duffel bag, unzips and glances within 
        it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> The clown escorts Jerome through large and empty interiors 
        to the back of the building. Jerome takes out one of his own cigarettes 
        but does not light it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Outside Jerome finds himself in a concrete landscape. 
        There is nothing alive, only an empty parkinglot. Chain link ivy climbs 
        the walls of abandoned buildings.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">He lights his cigarette and <a href="jc.html">walks toward 
        the center of town</a>. </font></p>

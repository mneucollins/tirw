<!--In the beginning was the word In the beginning was the word, but the word was alone... In the beginning was the word, but the word was alone...and  so a companion was made from  its rib... Her And the new word created a chasm in the mind of Stravinsky Jones, for She was no longer enough to contain what he wanted. And the new word created a chasm in the mind of Stravinsky Jones, for She was no longer enough to contain what he wanted. In the vernacular... She was fine, but what about Her? The emotions inside him longed for expression. Again, one was not enough... Platonic Agape A love triangle ensued Stravinsky ,  his wife , and  his friend Eros Stravinsky,  the musical ingenuous Stravinsky,  his wife , and his friend Sonja, formerly his teacher. Stravinsky, his wife, and his friend Klezmer partner, lover, spy, Natasha Wife Spin Stravinsky  And Stravinsky's world  began to turn on its head.  He argued with Sonja that night she kicked him towards the Promenade. Her:  The  object of his best intentions "So when are you  going to give up this klezmer hobby?"  Klezmer survived the Holocaust. "Your father did, too." (Hers had not.) "Are you  going to  tell Sonja?" Where would I begin? She: A shiksa with a  rousing, raucous laugh Locked mouths,  having "trash talked" Starbucks, having licked at Pretzels, having sung Paul  Simon, ecumenized. "So when are you  going to give up this  klezmer hobby?"  Klezmer survived the Holocaust. "Your father did, too." (Hers had not.) She was everything to him, like a brother. Platonic: An ideal  based on a lack of lust. There was no way of knowing who was on top, when each was the  object of so much muted affection. "Wanted to see how  things were going?" We're taking a break. Her:  The  name of the other; lover; other lover. Sonja called while he rehearsed.  She knew him and could  feel him slipping into that melody, on someone else's strings. "Whisper, when you cannot say a gift," he had told Natasha. Agape: The open mouth Stravinsky cannot shut. Under his brow's edge as he leaned to turn  the page, he saw her,  holding a giant, amber smoothie.  The  pizzicato bars of music rattled. Are we just doing this so we have kids to stay together for? Her: A him he would  serve with pleasure. They would stay up late every night, as he massaged her  temples, as they  watched children's  programs for  encouragement. Sonja did not mean to be his friend, said the card in his shorts. Eros: Great passion; Stravinsky love. Of course, when they saw each other there were three cigarettes between them. He burned a  hole in the patch his ex-lover had sewn. He shared her secret cycle of songs. Eros: what threatens Stravinsky's survival. Natasha hummed  mornings in the concert hall of the kitchen in her apartment where they met to practice. She was everything to him, like a brother "To play, pull  over taut   strings that   which is  ever    flexible." Student: He  who studies  her face for  downbeats. For forty nights, he watched her play  before she deigned  to grant an audience.     Teach me.   "What do you  want to learn?" Out of the  corner of his eye as he  spun he  thought he spied her. Promenade:  A call to  dance. "Dosido," Natasha  said. Avec moi? he asked.  Music was their vernacular.  The  language mattered  little. "This music is fun." It's history. "Now dance." Her:  One you can give to easily, no  strings. There was a dance  he'd watched her do,  while playing the  up-tempo klezmer  songs.  Klezmerized  he'd dubbed her.  She was in a trance. I could learn to have a  life in your place. Teacher One who  talks more than listens. They walked for  hours around a graveyard across  from a nursery. He imagined the mouths open wide on this their last walk. They both had books,  but she'd  snatch his while they  slept. Eros: A science without blackboards. "It's not about that." Then show me. "Fine. Give me your hand and draw..." He didn't see the music fall and this was a begining. I've been learning a lot from my partner in klezmer, said Jones. Partner:  Party to the  second part. At the Symphony gala, she didn't let  slide his remark about  klezmer, but seized it  and made it her own.   "Does she have  beautiful hair?" Tighter. "No, feel it first." It's fine. "No," she turns, "now." Wife: a  woman  disposed to patient ex pain ation. Every day at 7, like clockwork, she would open his violin case, slide the Dresden's lip beneath his chin, and lay his fingers on the strings and tighten. "Look, Strav, no Jews." You're  surprised? Wife: WIF' n. spouse also  past perfect form waif. Found her fourth grade primer that she saved from her arrival to the States.   It told tales of Aryan children who played American games. "I saw you  play the  other night. Both of you." Okay. "Not really." She: p. referring to  the woman. When they laughed, there was always something hanging around, like a ghost or vampire,  something simple, haunting, inevitable. The  Promenade  shimmered  with pre- Christmas  tidings. Friend: who comes upon mutual desire. Stravinsky played Hava Nagila as couples  approached, having fled the robot man,  who leered at the  girl of twelve. Turn the page. "My, you're slow." Read aloud. "Yes,"   Natasha lisps. Friend:  an  unteachable acquaintance. He watched her lips as she watched his.  It was not like looking  into one mirror but  like standing still in a downpour and seeing yourself in the drops. Sonja can clearly see boundaries and barbed wire. Friend: One who hears  what we  can't say. They walked along the Promenade, past the Chinese man, spinning a ball on his head. Stravinsky  wonders, is klezmer  Jewish ball-spinning? Read, Tasha, "I am  reading," she laughs, "you." Teacher: she who shows him into her room. In Natasha's studio, scattered texts of Heraclitus, Jung, and Yeats, tossed about a log cabin quilt like spent suitors. They walked along the Promenade, past the Chinese man, spinning a ball on his head. Stravinsky  wonders is Klezmer  Jewish ball spinning? Turn the  page. "My, you read slowly." I don't read, I spin. Agape: shocking Bible stories. "Lot's wife turned to stone." Salt, you Philistine. "Yours isn't salt yet, is she?" No, but she's always looking back. Natasha's eyes, for the first time, set down their bags. Spy: She whose hands enjoy his pockets. "It's a girl," reads the note in his pocket. She slides it back  before he can notice. She puts down her clarinet and grows tired. The lovers  had one night of blasphemy in Natasha's dim lair. Agape: Shocking Bible  Stories. "Lot's wife turned to stone." Salt, you Philistine. "Yours isn't salt at all, is she?" No, but she is  always looking back. She did not mean to be his friend, said the card in his shorts. She had  given him instruction,  gently.  Bowing. Platonic: a temporary connection extended. She would not  give him the  satisfaction of being only the one kind of  wife he had read  about in high school. Of course, when they saw each other there were three cigarettes  between them. He burned a  hole in the patch his ex-lover had sewn. Will you read  to me? "But you're  the page I'm turning." Friend: One who lets you read  between her lines. In Natasha's studio  apartment, Heraclitus, Jung, and Yeats,  lay strewn across her log cabin quilt like spent suitors. Natasha held his hand in a gesture she liked to consider friendly. Agape: love between  Jews and Gentiles. Juking out the rose-peddling gypsies and sign-holding homeless, listeners congregated to hear the klezmer's rousing rounds. Eros: Great passion Stravinsky love. Will you read  to me? "But you're  the page I'm turning. Friend: One with ears tuned to the same key. Sonja would not  give him the  satisfaction of being only the one kind of  wife he had read  about in high school. He had one  prayer that their baby would have her hair. Agape: Solemnized Sacrifized Sinless Sex The instruction she gave in the simplest of all matters, from  sensing the stroke of  the bow across the strings to flattening  a song to sadness. Juking out the rose-peddling gypsies and sign-holding homeless, listeners congregated to hear the klezmer's rousing  rounds. Found her fourth grade primer that she saved from her arrival to the States.   It told tales of Arian children who played American games. They met  over drinks at a fundraiser for his wife's symphony. Wife: a pronoun for his dancing partner. "You could teach me  klezmer," the blonde woman laughed.  Ha! You're not even Jewish.  "What, there's a  secret handshake?" Water drips  from the  warn neck of the aged violin. Teacher: One who  impregnates  with old  thoughts. "I came and saw you on the Promenade,  after the fight. I had to tell you about  a secret. There, I  found you had your  own." Lessons? But my wife is the virtuoso.   "So," she blushed, "I know." Student: one who seeks  instruction. He's let "I know" fly above the memory  of their affair's inception, brushing against his cheek  with mosquito wings. Sonja called often  while he rehearsed.   She knew him and  could feel him  slipping into that  melody, on someone  else's strings. Pouring over his music, Sonja found a piece: "To her  on the day of grand  announcement,"  and learned it by heart at a glance. To be  performed with flare and feeling, up-tempo, waltz time. Wife: One  who is still thinking it  over. "It's a good omen." A fertile          sign. Agape: love that sees eternity in ducks.   They had snuck into the cemetery on  their honeymoon night to watch the stripe-necked  waterfowl dance. "Hello..." Shhhhh.... "But no one's here to wake." Nonetheless. They wrapped  melodies around each other, playing from their windows at  night, listening for  each other.  She read all afternoon  and night. He could not  budge her. Student: She who adds up the wrong  answers. Sonja sat on the futon, leafing  through that 4th grade reader, spindly tear threads, reading, "Beatrice embraces her parents." They met  over drinks at a fund raiser for his wife's symphony. "You could teach me  Klezmer," the blonde woman laughed.  Ha! You're not even Jewish.  "What, there's a  secret handshake?" Water drips  from the  worn neck of the aged violin. "I came and saw you on the promenade,  after the fight. I had to tell you about  a secret. There, I  found you had your  own." They had snuck into the cemetary, on  their honeymoon night to watch the stripe-necked  waterfowl dance. "It's not about that." Then show me. "Fine. Give me your hand and draw..." He didn't see the music fall and this was a beginning. Wife: a  woman  disposed to patient ex-paination. Her: receiver of glances,  music, and other coded messages. Sonja sat one the futon, leafing  through that 4th grade reader, spindly tear threads, reading, "Beatrice embraces her parents." "Whisper, when you cannot say a gift," he had told her. She hummed  mornings,  in the concert hall of the kitchen in her apartment where they met to practice. Partner Accomplice He trusted her explicitly. Implicitly was a  different story. Accomplice: One who aids and abeds. The invitation was accepted on the  basis of the  reattachment of  strings.  His had  broken on the  final chord. stravinsky's MUSE Stravinsky played Havanagila as couples  approached, having fled  the robot man,  who leered at the  girl of twelve. I've been learning a lot from my partner in Klezmer, said Jones. "It's a girl," read the note in his pocket. She slid it back before he could notice. She puts down her clarinet and grows tired. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"

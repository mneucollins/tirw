<p><b>  Remembering Donald Justice, page 2 <br>
</b></p>
<p>Unlike Bishop, though, Don&rsquo;s fame as a teacher rivaled, and perhaps at times eclipsed, his reputation as a poet.&nbsp; He was my teacher for one academic year, from 1977-1978, at the University of Iowa&rsquo;s Writers Workshop.&nbsp; I took his workshop for one semester, and I enrolled in two seminars: one on poetic meter and one on the Elizabethan sonnet and Romantic ode.&nbsp; He also supervised my thesis.&nbsp; Don was one among three teachers who exerted the most powerful influence on me, an influence so strong that I had to overthrow it&mdash;consciously and painfully&mdash;in order to grow as a poet.</p>
<p>Many have testified to Don&rsquo;s rigorous attention as a teacher.&nbsp; Many have said that, through his tutelage and example, they learned what it meant to write poetry<em> by the line</em>&mdash;for Don, the only way to write it&mdash;and many have spoken about his insistence on clarity and exactitude, and his impatience for theorizing of any sort, especially regarding the relationship between meter and content.&nbsp; &ldquo;The meters move along in their own domain, scarcely intersecting the domain of meaning,&rdquo; he wrote in <em>Meter and Memory&mdash;</em>one of the best essays in defense of metrical writing I know of&mdash;and he went on, with his characteristically acerbic yet lyrical wit, to debunk what he took to be a shibboleth about &ldquo;the meters&rdquo; and their kinship to &ldquo;natural&rdquo; rhythms:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whether their nature really embodies an imitation of natural processes may be arguable. . . .&nbsp; We do inhale and exhale more or less rhythmically, as long as we stay healthy; our hearts do beat without much skipping&hellip;.but any connection between them and the more or less regular alternation of weak and strong syllables in verse seems to me doubtful&hellip;. Signals timed to regulate the flow of traffic not only seem analogous but at times remarkably beautiful, as on a nearly deserted stretch of Ninth Avenue in New York City at three A.M., especially in a mild drizzle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That swerve from skeptical analysis to a muted perceptual rhapsody&mdash;it&rsquo;s a characteristic of Don&rsquo;s best prose, poetry, and pedagogy.</p>
<p>He once brought in a recording by Bessie Smith, played &ldquo;Nobody Knows You When You&rsquo;re Down and Out&rdquo; without comment, then sat there.&nbsp; Finally, someone worked up the nerve to ask the point of this prelude to a workshop discussion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes we need to be reminded of the value of simplicity,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Then class began. &nbsp;Some of his former students remember him as frightening, and it&rsquo;s true that he could express, often with terse body language, his exasperation with callow aesthetic pronouncements.&nbsp; But I remember Don reserving his crankiness for what we <em>said about</em> poems in workshop, not for our poems (whether he approved of them or not).&nbsp; If a workshop comment struck Don as especially unfaithful to the text under discussion, he&rsquo;d often whip off his glasses and hold the worksheet up close to his eyes, as if a literal &ldquo;closer inspection&rdquo; would reveal the aptness of the remark.&nbsp; Teaching writing, Don simultaneously taught reading.</p>
<p>But no, I never found Don frightening&mdash;even while he maintained a distance from his students and, I believe, cultivated his reputation as a teacher who employed koans.&nbsp; The syllabus for his seminar on meter included this statement and qualification: &ldquo;We will study examples of the traditional meters of English poetry:&nbsp; iambic pentameter, tetrameter, etc.&nbsp; We will also examine free verse&mdash;some kinds, not all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second sentence sent ripples of apprehension through the students registered for the course.&nbsp; What types of free verse did Don consider <em>un</em>worthy of examination? &nbsp;Since most of us wrote nothing <em>but</em> free-verse (it was 1977), we wondered whether &ldquo;our&rdquo; types of free verse would be honored by inclusion or dishonored by exclusion.&nbsp; On the first day of class, someone asked what he meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not all forms of free verse have been invented yet,&rdquo; he said (do I remember a wink?), &ldquo;so we obviously can&rsquo;t study those.&rdquo;&nbsp; An opposite quality to Don&rsquo;s teaching involved his penetrating straightforwardness.&nbsp; He based that other seminar I took on the simplest of premises:&nbsp; the English sonnet reached a kind of pinnacle of excellence in the 16th and 17th centuries; while in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the English Romantics brought another poetic form, the ode, to near perfection.&nbsp; Let us study them, <em>as </em>forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formal virtue&rdquo;&mdash;a term Don used often, both in print and in class&mdash;encapsulates his definition of successful art.&nbsp;For him, aesthetic exactitude equaled moral probity, at least for the artist.&nbsp; But Don was in no way a &ldquo;formalist&rdquo; in the reductive sense of the term&mdash;that is, a poet who only employed traditional, symmetrical prosody.&nbsp; Even many of his admirers tend to forget that Don mastered open forms just as thoroughly as he mastered forms received from the tradition.&nbsp; His experiments in short-lined and long-lined free verse constitute some of the strongest contemporary responses to the inventions of Williams, Stevens, and Pound.&nbsp; His essay, &ldquo;The Free-Verse Line in Stevens,&rdquo; reveals an ear fine-tuned to the rigors of non-metrical improvisation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe I ever heard Don use the crude, imprecise distinction between &ldquo;free verse&rdquo; and &ldquo;formal verse,&rdquo; which we hear so often these days from poets who should know better.</p>
<p>After I left Iowa, Don and I remained in sporadic touch, but never became friends.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to believe that by the time he was my teacher, he&rsquo;d more or less given up establishing friendships with former students, but I suspect that&rsquo;s just self-consolation.&nbsp; I corresponded with him on occasion, spent time with him at Bread Loaf and one or two other writing conferences, and attended a reading he gave at Boston University&mdash;the <em>only </em>time, as far as I know, that he read in this city between 1979 and his death.&nbsp; In place of intimate conversation, we talked about the movies.&nbsp; (I nurture a quiet satisfaction that, after the re-release of five of Hitchcock&rsquo;s films, Don came to agree with me that <em>Vertigo</em> was superior to <em>Rear Window.</em>)&nbsp; In 1987, at Bread Loaf, he inscribed my copy of <em>The Sunset Maker </em>with a sequence of words I committed to memory the first time I read it:&nbsp; &ldquo;To Steve Cramer&mdash;the elegance and eloquence of whose poems I like to think I saw a little earlier than some other readers did.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reading this, I felt enormous gratification, and some shock.&nbsp; During the year I studied with Don at Iowa, although I sensed that he took my writing seriously, I never knew whether or not he really &ldquo;liked my work.&rdquo;&nbsp; He encouraged my early efforts to write metrically; he supported my commitment to clarity at a time when obscurity&rsquo;s stock was up.&nbsp; He wrote brief comments on my poems&mdash;<em>Excellent details; how much does the poem matter?&nbsp; I like how you move from stage to stage; Mixed feelings, yours and mine </em>(that last my favorite)&mdash;but I imagine I&rsquo;m not alone among his former students in remaining uncertain about Don&rsquo;s final evaluation.</p>
<p> I do remember, indelibly, a moment when I realized Don did <em>not </em>approve of a poem I&rsquo;d written.&nbsp; In 1991, reading at the Catskills Poetry Workshop&mdash;Don a faculty member; me a visiting representative of <em>The Atlantic Monthly&mdash;</em>I launched into a new poem about an LSD trip: all uneven line lengths, jagged enjambments, and hallucinatory imagery.&nbsp; A few lines into it, I saw Don wince, shake his head, and lean over and whisper (terribly!) to whoever sat next to him&mdash;a whisper, I&rsquo;m sure, having nothing to do with &ldquo;elegance&rdquo; or &ldquo;eloquence,&rdquo; two qualities I&rsquo;d deliberately avoided in writing this poem.&nbsp; Afterwards, when he tepidly mentioned another poem I&rsquo;d read (one more like the work I&rsquo;d written at Iowa) as his &ldquo;favorite,&rdquo; I felt some awkwardness, his and mine&mdash;but, curiously, only a little hurt.&nbsp; Much longer afterwards, I remembered this moment as my release from Don as mentor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a release all writers must undergo&mdash;that is, if they have had mentors and if they wish to grow toward the work they&rsquo;re meant to write. <a href="justice_essay3.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

<p><b>  Remembering Donald Justice, page 3 </b></p>
<p>That notion, &ldquo;the work we&rsquo;re meant to write,&rdquo; might also have made Don wince, although it&rsquo;s not that far a cry from his idea of the Platonic script&mdash;the ideal poem pre-existing the poem on paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like to think that all true poems exist before their authors write them down,&rdquo; he said in an interview, &ldquo;you can picture them floating about, say, in a sort of Platonic realm; and they are perfect there.&nbsp; It is our job to see that even as they enter the dimensional world they come close to their original form.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder his output was so sparse!&nbsp; In print and in person, Don often referred quite candidly to his regret at not having written more.&nbsp; Just before that 1987 Bread Loaf conference, he&rsquo;d spent a month at Yaddo.&nbsp; By chance, I ran into him as he arrived and was pulling his luggage from the trunk of his car.&nbsp; I took a bag and walked with him to his cottage, our conversation another spot of time:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Where are you coming from?&rdquo; I asked, schoolboy-proud to be his first Bread Loaf encounter, hoping some other participants might see us walking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just spent a month at Yaddo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get a lot of work done?&rdquo; I fawned, still very much his eager, cheerleading acolyte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, his face tightening with real chagrin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d planned to finish a verse play, but I hit a dead end.&nbsp; And now I know I won&rsquo;t finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t exactly remember what else he said, but I know it had to do with the demoralizing feeling of another project left incomplete.&nbsp; The purity of his disappointment startled me into silence.&nbsp; I remember nothing else of the walk.&nbsp; That rueful wish to have done more&mdash;or to have gotten it right, once and for all&mdash;shows up as well in diffident revisions he made to early work in his first <em>Selected Poems </em>(1979) and then repealed for his 1995 <em>New and Selected.&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;To my mind, the changes he made in the former book were invariably mistakes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give a single example.&nbsp; &ldquo;But That Is Another Story&rdquo; is a kind of postscript to every Jane Austen novel.&nbsp; Here it is as it appeared in <em>Night Light </em>(1967), Don&rsquo;s second collection:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I do not think the ending can be right.<br>
          How can they marry and live happily<br>
          Forever, these who were so passionate<br>
          At chapter&rsquo;s end?&nbsp; Once they are settled in<br>
          The quiet country house, what will they do,<br>
          So many miles from anywhere?<br>
          Those blond ancestral ghosts crowding the stair,<br>
          Surely they disapprove?&nbsp; Ah me,<br>
          I fear love will catch cold and die<br>
          From pacing naked through those drafty halls<br>
          Night after night.&nbsp; Poor Frank.&nbsp; Poor Imogene.<br>
          Before them now their lives<br>
          Stretch empty as great Empire beds<br>
          After the lovers rise and the damp sheets<br>
          Are stripped by envious chambermaids.</p>
    <p>        And if the first night passes brightly enough,<br>
        What with the bonfires lit with old love letters,<br>
        That is no inexhaustible fuel, perhaps?<br>
        Time knows how it must end, not I.<br>
        Will Frank walk out one day<br>
        Alone through the ruined orchard with his stick,<br>
        Strewing the path with lissome heads<br>
        Of buttercups?&nbsp; Will Imogene<br>
        Conceal in the crotches of old trees<br>
        Love notes for grizzled gardeners and such?<br>
        Meanwhile they quarrel and make it up,<br>
        Only to quarrel again.&nbsp; A sudden storm<br>
        Pulls the last fences down.&nbsp; Now moonstruck sheep<br>
        Stray through the garden all night peering in<br>
        At the exhausted lovers where they sleep. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For the 1979 <em>Selected, </em>Don altered one of my favorite lines in this favored poem&mdash;&ldquo;That is no inexhaustible fuel, perhaps?&rdquo;&mdash;to &ldquo;That is no inexhaustible fuel, I think.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s severe enough damage done to this poem of melancholy questioning.&nbsp; But Don went further, altering the exquisite last sentence to something that feels like deliberate self-sabotage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;.The stupid sheep<br>
          Stand out all night now coughing in the garden<br>
          And peering through the windows where they sleep.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercifully, by 1995 Don had come to his senses on this poem, and most of the other second-guesses scattered through <em>Selected Poems.&nbsp; </em>I&rsquo;d still debate him, if I could, on his decision to add exclamation points to &ldquo;Poor Frank. Poor Imogene.&rdquo; in all versions after the one quoted above.&nbsp; The poem&rsquo;s empathy is murmured, not exclaimed. </p>
<p>The last time I saw Don&mdash;at that 1991 Catskills Poetry Workshop&mdash;we debated quite a bit:&nbsp; on the merits of Bill Moyers and Keith Jarrett, on whether <em>The Atlantic Monthly </em>had first published Auden&rsquo;s &ldquo;September 1, 1939.&rdquo;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d recently undergone bypass, and needed to rest frequently.&nbsp; He struck me as dispirited, and even bitter&mdash;not simply skeptical&mdash;about developments in poetry.&nbsp; He defended some of the new formalist poets whose work represented, to me, much that was mediocre about that movement.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t recall if I argued back&mdash;if I claimed, as I believe, that &ldquo;new formalism&rdquo; is a misnomer when applied to many of the school&rsquo;s adherents, who have done little <em>new </em>with form; but, in the main, have employed traditional meters without the variations and syncopations that characterize the best of the &ldquo;old&rdquo; formalists, such as Don.&nbsp; A brief letter after the conference, his last to me, expressed thanks for my sending him proof that Auden&rsquo;s &ldquo;September 1, 1939&rdquo; hadn&rsquo;t originally appeared in <em>The Atlantic Monthly,</em> along with what I take to be a guarded apology for the weary distractedness I sensed:&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it was good to see you &amp; also Hilary at Pine Lake&mdash;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t been quite so tired much of the time.&nbsp; Now, at last, I <em>am </em>rested. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the current&mdash;and, I suppose, final&mdash;record of his work, <em>Collected Poems </em>(2004)<em>, </em>we have them all, in their correct, if not wholly Platonic, form.&nbsp; I hope this book will put to rest some of the inaccuracies about Don&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;most egregiously, that he was a stylist without significant subjects.&nbsp; What poem captures the soul-poverty of the American 1930s better than his &ldquo;Pantoum of the Great Depression?&rdquo;&nbsp; Has the post-WW II &ldquo;man in the grey suit&rdquo; found better voice than in &ldquo;Men at Forty&rdquo;?&nbsp; A small sub-group of Don&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;&ldquo;Counting the Mad,&rdquo; &ldquo;On a Painting by Patient B of the Independence State Hospital for the Insane,&rdquo; &ldquo;For the Suicides,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Letter,&rdquo; and probably others I&rsquo;m not remembering&mdash;stares at madness, if not in the face, than from a characteristically oblique angle that renders the view more harrowing.&nbsp; Rereading his poems for this essay, I was intrigued by how frequently Satan makes an appearance; and how often he places poems in Hell.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to devalue his accomplishments of style, but simply to suggest that his craft serviced urgently felt responses to human subjects.&nbsp; Another common claim&mdash;Don as heir to Wallace Stevens&mdash;always struck me as dismissible. &nbsp;Wayne Brown found &ldquo;The Snowfall&rdquo; reminiscent of Philip Larkin, a comparison at least as apt as the analogies to Stevens.&nbsp; When Larkin died, of course, he was England&rsquo;s best-known poet; in a smaller country, perhaps Don&rsquo;s poetry would have had a larger reputation.</p>
<p><em>Collected Poems</em> includes ten new pieces, at least four of which seem to me significant additions to American poetry, but I wonder whether even this book will settle the debate about Don&rsquo;s stature:&nbsp; impeccable, if minor, stylist; or major, if muted, voice of restless, American experimentalism.&nbsp; My biased vote goes for the latter:&nbsp; Don was an experimentalist in the true sense of the word&mdash;he tried out everything.&nbsp; But &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor,&rdquo; easy dichotomies, fall short of defining a poet like Don, who in any case pursued what he called, in &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; &ldquo;the major resolution of the minor.&rdquo;&nbsp; To hear that resolution, the amplitude of <em>the less said the better,</em> perhaps all we need to do is to quiet down a bit and listen. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

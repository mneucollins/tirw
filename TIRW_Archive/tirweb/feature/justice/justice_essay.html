    <p>THE SNOWFALL</p>
    <p>The classic landscapes of dreams are not<br>
          More pathless, though footprints leading nowhere<br>
          Would seem to prove that a people once<br>
          Survived for a little even here.</p>
    <p>Fragments of a pathetic culture<br>
          Remain, the lost mittens of children,<br>
          And a single, bright, detasseled snow cap,<br>
          Evidence of some frantic migration.</p>
    <p>The landmarks are gone.&nbsp; Nevertheless,<br>
          There is something familiar about this country.<br>
          Slowly now we begin to recall</p>
    <p>The terrible whispers of our elders<br>
          Falling softly about our ears<br>
          In childhood, never believed till now.</p>

<p>When I learned that my former teacher Donald Justice had died, I wanted to show a poem of his to a new friend&mdash;the Caribbean writer Wayne Brown&mdash;who was not familiar with his work.&nbsp; I chose &ldquo;The Snowfall,&rdquo; one of my favorites of Don&rsquo;s early poetry, but hardly one of his anthology pieces.&nbsp; For me, it captures much that was fugitive, reticent, yet deeply affecting, about the art and the man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even his death had the quality of a rumor.&nbsp; He died on August 6, 2004.&nbsp; The next day, a friend informed me via email.&nbsp; The first obituary I know of appeared on August 8 in <em>The Miami Herald; </em>the <em>New York Times </em>took two more days to report his death.&nbsp; In Boston, the land of Bishop and Lowell, <em>The Globe</em> waited seven days before picking up an Associated Press obituary<em>.&nbsp; </em>I assume the citizens of Iowa City learned of his death first, and I imagine the news radiating out from that Midwestern poetry capital, like those concentric waves from the radio tower in the 1930s <em>RKO Pictures </em>logo, but in slow motion.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;d like to think that Don, a lifelong cinephile, would have appreciated that image; my guess is he&rsquo;d have known the precise term, if there is one, for the frame that identifies a movie studio.)<strong></strong></p>
<p>American poetry is regional. &nbsp;The South reveres James Dickey the way New England honors Lowell and Bishop.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;s life and work mostly took place in Florida and Iowa, and while he did not &ldquo;die in Miami&rdquo;&mdash;as he predicted in his &ldquo;Variations on a Text by Vallejo&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s fitting that many of those most immediately affected by his death have, or had, close connections to one or the other of those states.&nbsp; In another sense, however, geographical responses to Don&rsquo;s death strike me as odd, considering that he won the Pulitzer Prize and that his legion of former students includes both widely scattered and widely honored American poets.&nbsp; Perhaps his reputation will now begin to permeate the wider poetic culture, as did Bishop&rsquo;s after her death&mdash;a poet he resembles in many ways.&nbsp; Like her, he was often called a &ldquo;poet&rsquo;s poet,&rdquo; his quiet precision appealing to those who read poetry for the way it behaves like no other verbal art.&nbsp; Like her, his spare output had readers waiting, often for years, for a new example of his artistry. <a href="justice_essay2.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

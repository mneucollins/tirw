          AN INTERVIEW WITH ANA MARIA URIBE </b> </div>
        <p><br>
          <b>Megan Sapnar:</b> Visual poets describe their work in different ways. 
          You refer to your pieces as &quot;anipoetry&quot; -- is this a term 
          that you coined, referring to Web-based animated visual poems? And how 
          would you relate your term to others, such as visual, concrete, or experimental 
          poetry?</p>
        <p><b>Ana Maria Uribe:</b>Well, I've called them &quot;Anipoems&quot; 
          in reference to (and in contrast with) my own static Typoems of the 
          late 60s. Those earlier poems may indeed have been influenced by Christian 
          Morgenstern, the <a href="http://www.ubu.com/papers/solt/brazil.html" target="_blank">Brazilian 
          concretes</a>, and Gomringer. </p>
        <p>Typoems were limited by one fixed font, the size and vertical position 
          of the page on the typewriter, and the black ink ribbon. I've maintained 
          most of these restrictions in the animated poems: they never exceed 
          the size of the screen, so you don't have to scroll up and down, they 
          generally are in one font only, and -- from 1997 to 2000 -- all except 
          four were created in black and white. I started using color in 2001. 
        </p>
        <p>So my Anipoems are visual and indirectly influenced by &quot;concrete,&quot; 
          but I rather resist the term &quot;experimental poetry&quot; as applied 
          to them because I really don't feel I'm intentionally experimenting...I 
          consider my work quite spontaneous. </p>
        <p><b>MS:</b> Spontaneous, yes, they feel that way. Nevertheless, for 
          our readers, can you say more about who or what are your most important 
          influences -- the inspirations for your work?</p>
        <p><b>AMU:</b> Sources of inspiration are the letters themselves, my own 
          static works, and to some extent the Web and its tools, although generally 
          I don't use interaction, scripting or generative devices (I may use 
          them in the future, though). In addition to what I said about limitations--self-enforced 
          or deriving from the medium--I would add that the very process of overcoming 
          them is an extra source of ideas. </p>
        <p><b>MS</b>: Your pieces rely strongly on the integration of sound, motion 
          and--as you just said--the visual components of typographical and grammatical 
          signs. Is there one component or code that you consider most essential 
          to your work? Is your work organized primarily around motion, sound, 
          or typographical signs? How important is rhythm in your pieces?</p>
        <p><b>AMU:</b> I would say the main components are typography and motion, 
          in that order. And once motion is added, rhythm becomes all important, 
          since I work with repetition and short sequences of elements. </p>
        <p>Sound really matters in very few pieces. Some poems (for example, Balance 
          and Balance 2, among those published here) originally had no sound--they 
          were animated gifs and many of them have been published as such. I added 
          sound to capture people's attention while the web pages downloaded, 
          although sometimes the images downloaded before the sound did! Then 
          I got used to the sound being there, so now I have incorporated it into 
          the poems. </p>
        <p><b>MS:</b> By publishing your work on the Internet, it is obviously 
          available to a global audience. Do you think a reader's first language 
          influences the way your work is interpreted or understood? </p>
        <p>For example, &quot;i&quot; is not a word in Spanish, but it is one 
          of the most important words in English. Do you see your work as somehow 
          transgressing language barriers?</p>
        <p><b>AMU:</b><br>
          Good question! It is true that although most of my work is meant to 
          be free from language constraints--inasmuch at it detaches itself from 
          the word and relies more on letters and typographical signs--nevertheless, 
          English- and Spanish-speakers tend to approach the work from different 
          angles. They are attracted by different pieces. </p>
        <p>For example, I have an animated series called Ladders. They are ladders 
          and stairways that go up and down leading nowhere. Some people in my 
          country (Argentina) find something mysterious or esoteric in them, but 
          they are generally not noticed by the English speaking public, who prefer 
          the more playful pieces. </p>
        <p>While individual letters undoubtedly have different connotations according 
          to the reader's native language, I believe there are other powerful 
          cultural aspects that account for differences as well.</p>
        <p><b>MS:</b> Thanks, Ana Maria.</p>

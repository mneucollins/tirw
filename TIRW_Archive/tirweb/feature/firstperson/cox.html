<p>Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan&rsquo;s <em>First Person:&nbsp; New Media as Story, Performance, and Game</em> brings together prominent scholars, game designers and artists writing on how computer-based games, game equipment and literature have been interpreted, adopted and conceptualized in a field the editors nominate as the &ldquo;new media &lsquo;story, performance, game&rsquo; field&rdquo; (289). Whereas Wardrip-Fruin&rsquo;s previous co-edited anthology, The<em> New Media Reader</em>, provided a substantial, wide-ranging, and thoroughly theoretical introduction to the field, <em>First Person </em>focuses more narrowly on a single theme with its own inroads and subsets: gaming. </p>
<p>In their introduction, the editors make the case for foregrounding game equipment and literature as the primary focus of <em>First Person</em> by arguing that both have come to serve as&nbsp; &ldquo;new media&rdquo; and &ldquo;real life&rdquo; entities. Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan cite the ambiguous relationship between stories and games as one of the major focal points of the collection in referencing popular, arguably story-driven, computer games like <em>The Sims </em>and <em>Black and White</em>.&nbsp; A second major focal point is a consideration of the nature of literature in new media.&nbsp; The editors aim to present analyses of complex linguistic forms made possible by new media.&nbsp; The text provides examples of &ldquo;new literary/linguistic experiences&hellip;that in their internal procedures or audience interaction can be thought of as performance or gameplay&rdquo; (xii) in an attempt to move readers to examine and re-examine the latter two terms.</p>
<p>The book can be divided into roughly two segments of four sections each.&nbsp; The first four sections of the text consider areas relevant for digital game study:&nbsp; cyberdramatists linking games and narrativity; ludologists asserting the need to treat the gaming situation uniquely apart from narrative concerns; critical simulation scholars exploring relations between the simulated and the real; and game theorists defining the nature of game itself.&nbsp; The sections comprising the first half of the book feature contributions from prominent digital games scholars like Janet Murray discussing cyberdrama, Markku Eskelinen arguing for a disciplinary place for game studies, Espen Aarseth navigating between the terms game and story, Gonzalo Frasca engaging the possibility of critical digital games, and Jesper Juul theorizing time in digital games.&nbsp; These sections cohere around some of the more important issues of concern to digital game studies such as the narratology-ludology debate, ethics and digital games, and the notion of game.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The second segment of the book moves from the discussion of games into hypertexts and interactives, the meaning of digital text and writing, digitally facilitated interaction and new textual forms made possible by digital technology.&nbsp; Although this segment provides many interesting essays, it does not appear to share the same degree of cohesion as the first half of the book.&nbsp; That said, this more limited cohesion does not detract from the quality of the respective works, but allows <em>First Person </em>to address the questions surrounding new media as story, performance, and game from a variety of perspectives.&nbsp; This section presents an intriguing array of pieces from scholars and artists like Mark Bernstein and Diane Greco comparing hypertext generation software, Camille Utterback discussing artwork that challenges conventional interfaces, Warren Sack providing a model for the analysis of online large scale conversation, Natalie Jeremijenko wondering what happens with the interaction between humans and voice chips and Katherine Hayles analyzing new media art as an entr&eacute;e into questioning the potential for a digital/human hybrid.&nbsp; This latter half of <em>First Person </em>presents readers with a panoply of texts and approaches to texts that move beyond considerations of new media and literature.</p>
<p><em>First Person</em>&rsquo;s primary strength concerns the sheer breadth of new media ideas and objects the collection analyzes.&nbsp; In their introduction to the last section of the book, Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan say that they hope &ldquo;that this book may serve as a sort of core sample of the new media &lsquo;story, performance, and game&rsquo; field at this stage in its development&rdquo; (289).&nbsp; After reading through the essays in the collection, the editors appear to have delivered on their promise.&nbsp; The book covers everything from how Aristotelian poetics might be applied to digital games to the relationship between schizophrenia and artificial intelligence to the experience of interacting with an online drama.&nbsp; This diversity provides readers with a solid introduction to some of the important questions theorists, artists, and game designers grapple with as they engage in their own work and consider the work of others.</p>
<p>An unfortunate side effect of <em>First Person&rsquo;s</em> topical reach concerns the relative length of the essays in the collection.&nbsp; Many of the pieces in the text are limited to roughly ten pages.&nbsp; Given the typographical layout of the book, a reasonable portion of the ten page space is devoted to reactions from respondents making the essays themselves that much shorter.&nbsp; Although the idea of allowing a response to be published in concert with a primary essay is sound and might be a worthwhile strategy for publishers to adopt, its execution in this text leaves this reader desiring more than what is received.&nbsp; Both the essays and responses appear terse at several points in the text.&nbsp; Consequently, some of the essays and the majority of the responses do not delve deeply enough into important issues to provide readers with a full sense of the issues being raised.&nbsp; Thus, the shorter essays make <em>First Person</em> more useful for the way its contributors provoke questions rather than the answers they provide.</p>
<p>A second strength concerns the structure of <em>First Person.&nbsp; </em>The editors choose to frame the essays as panel discussions by allowing two respondents working from different theoretical, technical and artistic perspectives to answer each primary essay with their own challenges, questions and ideas.&nbsp; These responses are printed beneath the primary essay yielding relatively easy access to the exchange between the panellists.&nbsp; The author of the initial essay is then given the opportunity to finish the print discussion by addressing the respondents&rsquo; respective critiques.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In most texts featuring dialogue, the conversation would halt at the primary author&rsquo;s reply to his/her respondents. &nbsp;However, Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan do not end the discussion with the final incarnation of the printed text.&nbsp; In keeping with the emphasis on interactivity, the <em>First Person </em>website accessed through the <em>electronic book review</em> offers a continuation of the print discussion online.&nbsp; Should one need more than the print commentary from each respondent, an extended electronic version can be found through the web addresses provided after the responses in the book. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a visit to the book&rsquo;s website reveals that readers may not be able to act in accordance with the editors&rsquo; intention that &ldquo;first person commentary&rdquo; be produced by those who read the essays.&nbsp; Given the introduction&rsquo;s claim about the potential for producing one&rsquo;s own response to the book&rsquo;s contents, this reviewer was expecting something akin to a discussion board, but was disappointed to see that the <em>electronic book review </em>had published only the fuller versions of the responses already begun in the printed version of <em>First Person </em>with, as of this writing, four exceptions from Jane McGonigal, Mark Barrett, Ian Bogost and Julian Raul Kucklich<em>.&nbsp; </em>How one can enter the online discussion leaves website visitors perplexed.&nbsp; Opening up the online discussion to any who would like to join could prove invaluable to the book&rsquo;s reception as a resource prompting further inquiry.&nbsp; Regrettably, the current partnership between book and website appears to close rather than open up the discussion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The website itself appears rather cumbersome and unwieldy as readers are required to decipher keyword hyperlinks such as &ldquo;subjunctive,&rdquo; &ldquo;grandiology,&rdquo; and &ldquo;metric&rdquo; in order to find the essays from <em>First Person</em>.&nbsp; This decoding might be enjoyable to some, but it could potentially create frustration for visitors desiring efficient access to a particular essay and its responses.&nbsp; Overall, the website&rsquo;s awkward design detracts from an otherwise excellent idea about uniting the material and the digital.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Taken as is, <em>First Person</em>, serves as a solid sampling of the variety of work being undertaken by new media scholars, artists and game designers.&nbsp; Each of the essays could function as a springboard from which further research might develop.&nbsp; The link between the paper and online segments of the book fails to realize its potential, but demonstrates a model of how partnerships between books and websites might be executed.&nbsp; <em>First Person </em>ultimately serves as an excellent collection of thought-provoking essays, even if the full extent of this provocation has not necessarily been realized.</p></td>

</table><p>Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan&rsquo;s <em>First Person:&nbsp; New Media as Story, Performance, and Game</em> brings together prominent scholars, game designers and artists writing on how computer-based games, game equipment and literature have been interpreted, adopted and conceptualized in a field the editors nominate as the &ldquo;new media &lsquo;story, performance, game&rsquo; field&rdquo; (289). Whereas Wardrip-Fruin&rsquo;s previous co-edited anthology, The<em> New Media Reader</em>, provided a substantial, wide-ranging, and thoroughly theoretical introduction to the field, <em>First Person </em>focuses more narrowly on a single theme with its own inroads and subsets: gaming. </p>
<p>In their introduction, the editors make the case for foregrounding game equipment and literature as the primary focus of <em>First Person</em> by arguing that both have come to serve as&nbsp; &ldquo;new media&rdquo; and &ldquo;real life&rdquo; entities. Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan cite the ambiguous relationship between stories and games as one of the major focal points of the collection in referencing popular, arguably story-driven, computer games like <em>The Sims </em>and <em>Black and White</em>.&nbsp; A second major focal point is a consideration of the nature of literature in new media.&nbsp; The editors aim to present analyses of complex linguistic forms made possible by new media.&nbsp; The text provides examples of &ldquo;new literary/linguistic experiences&hellip;that in their internal procedures or audience interaction can be thought of as performance or gameplay&rdquo; (xii) in an attempt to move readers to examine and re-examine the latter two terms.</p>
<p>The book can be divided into roughly two segments of four sections each.&nbsp; The first four sections of the text consider areas relevant for digital game study:&nbsp; cyberdramatists linking games and narrativity; ludologists asserting the need to treat the gaming situation uniquely apart from narrative concerns; critical simulation scholars exploring relations between the simulated and the real; and game theorists defining the nature of game itself.&nbsp; The sections comprising the first half of the book feature contributions from prominent digital games scholars like Janet Murray discussing cyberdrama, Markku Eskelinen arguing for a disciplinary place for game studies, Espen Aarseth navigating between the terms game and story, Gonzalo Frasca engaging the possibility of critical digital games, and Jesper Juul theorizing time in digital games.&nbsp; These sections cohere around some of the more important issues of concern to digital game studies such as the narratology-ludology debate, ethics and digital games, and the notion of game.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The second segment of the book moves from the discussion of games into hypertexts and interactives, the meaning of digital text and writing, digitally facilitated interaction and new textual forms made possible by digital technology.&nbsp; Although this segment provides many interesting essays, it does not appear to share the same degree of cohesion as the first half of the book.&nbsp; That said, this more limited cohesion does not detract from the quality of the respective works, but allows <em>First Person </em>to address the questions surrounding new media as story, performance, and game from a variety of perspectives.&nbsp; This section presents an intriguing array of pieces from scholars and artists like Mark Bernstein and Diane Greco comparing hypertext generation software, Camille Utterback discussing artwork that challenges conventional interfaces, Warren Sack providing a model for the analysis of online large scale conversation, Natalie Jeremijenko wondering what happens with the interaction between humans and voice chips and Katherine Hayles analyzing new media art as an entr&eacute;e into questioning the potential for a digital/human hybrid.&nbsp; This latter half of <em>First Person </em>presents readers with a panoply of texts and approaches to texts that move beyond considerations of new media and literature.</p>
<p><em>First Person</em>&rsquo;s primary strength concerns the sheer breadth of new media ideas and objects the collection analyzes.&nbsp; In their introduction to the last section of the book, Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan say that they hope &ldquo;that this book may serve as a sort of core sample of the new media &lsquo;story, performance, and game&rsquo; field at this stage in its development&rdquo; (289).&nbsp; After reading through the essays in the collection, the editors appear to have delivered on their promise.&nbsp; The book covers everything from how Aristotelian poetics might be applied to digital games to the relationship between schizophrenia and artificial intelligence to the experience of interacting with an online drama.&nbsp; This diversity provides readers with a solid introduction to some of the important questions theorists, artists, and game designers grapple with as they engage in their own work and consider the work of others. <a href="baerg2.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

<p><strong>Andrew Baerg's review of <em>First Person</em>, page 2 </strong></p>
<p>An unfortunate side effect of <em>First Person&rsquo;s</em> topical reach concerns the relative length of the essays in the collection.&nbsp; Many of the pieces in the text are limited to roughly ten pages.&nbsp; Given the typographical layout of the book, a reasonable portion of the ten page space is devoted to reactions from respondents making the essays themselves that much shorter.&nbsp; Although the idea of allowing a response to be published in concert with a primary essay is sound and might be a worthwhile strategy for publishers to adopt, its execution in this text leaves this reader desiring more than what is received.&nbsp; Both the essays and responses appear terse at several points in the text.&nbsp; Consequently, some of the essays and the majority of the responses do not delve deeply enough into important issues to provide readers with a full sense of the issues being raised.&nbsp; Thus, the shorter essays make <em>First Person</em> more useful for the way its contributors provoke questions rather than the answers they provide.</p>
<p>A second strength concerns the structure of <em>First Person.&nbsp; </em>The editors choose to frame the essays as panel discussions by allowing two respondents working from different theoretical, technical and artistic perspectives to answer each primary essay with their own challenges, questions and ideas.&nbsp; These responses are printed beneath the primary essay yielding relatively easy access to the exchange between the panellists.&nbsp; The author of the initial essay is then given the opportunity to finish the print discussion by addressing the respondents&rsquo; respective critiques.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In most texts featuring dialogue, the conversation would halt at the primary author&rsquo;s reply to his/her respondents. &nbsp;However, Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan do not end the discussion with the final incarnation of the printed text.&nbsp; In keeping with the emphasis on interactivity, the <em>First Person </em>website accessed through the <em>electronic book review</em> offers a continuation of the print discussion online.&nbsp; Should one need more than the print commentary from each respondent, an extended electronic version can be found through the web addresses provided after the responses in the book. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a visit to the book&rsquo;s website reveals that readers may not be able to act in accordance with the editors&rsquo; intention that &ldquo;first person commentary&rdquo; be produced by those who read the essays.&nbsp; Given the introduction&rsquo;s claim about the potential for producing one&rsquo;s own response to the book&rsquo;s contents, this reviewer was expecting something akin to a discussion board, but was disappointed to see that the <em>electronic book review </em>had published only the fuller versions of the responses already begun in the printed version of <em>First Person </em>with, as of this writing, four exceptions from Jane McGonigal, Mark Barrett, Ian Bogost and Julian Raul Kucklich<em>.&nbsp; </em>How one can enter the online discussion leaves website visitors perplexed.&nbsp; Opening up the online discussion to any who would like to join could prove invaluable to the book&rsquo;s reception as a resource prompting further inquiry.&nbsp; Regrettably, the current partnership between book and website appears to close rather than open up the discussion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The website itself appears rather cumbersome and unwieldy as readers are required to decipher keyword hyperlinks such as &ldquo;subjunctive,&rdquo; &ldquo;grandiology,&rdquo; and &ldquo;metric&rdquo; in order to find the essays from <em>First Person</em>.&nbsp; This decoding might be enjoyable to some, but it could potentially create frustration for visitors desiring efficient access to a particular essay and its responses.&nbsp; Overall, the website&rsquo;s awkward design detracts from an otherwise excellent idea about uniting the material and the digital.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Taken as is, <em>First Person</em>, serves as a solid sampling of the variety of work being undertaken by new media scholars, artists and game designers.&nbsp; Each of the essays could function as a springboard from which further research might develop.&nbsp; The link between the paper and online segments of the book fails to realize its potential, but demonstrates a model of how partnerships between books and websites might be executed.&nbsp; <em>First Person </em>ultimately serves as an excellent collection of thought-provoking essays, even if the full extent of this provocation has not necessarily been realized. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

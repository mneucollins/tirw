<p>In the first profile of the
documentary, Toni Dove demonstrates how far new media has come in the creation
of interactive narrative.  In
“Artificial Changelings”—an interactive film she describes as “a story about a
kleptomaniac, in nineteenth-century Paris during the rise of the department
store, who’s dreaming about an encryption hacker in the future”—Dove brings
together VR and video game technology with art sensibility to explore the ways
in which they allow the user to reshape the temporality of narrative. Frankly admitting her initial resistance to
interactive technologies, Dove claims that early hypertext works that came out
when the field was still in its infancy helped to create “misconceptions” about
possibilities of interactivity. </p>
<p>It is, therefore, a rather
provocative editorial decision on the part of director Seth Thompson to profile
hypertext pioneer Mark Amerika immediately after Dove, for Amerika’s
descriptions of his early hypertexts encapsulate precisely the rigidity that
initially turned Dove off of new media.  In fact, the juxtaposition between Dove’s physically interactive
narratives and Amerika’s oversimplified “liberate the reader” rhetoric suggests
that hypertext simply has not aged well.  Amerika’s descriptions come off as dated and his inclusion in the video
seems more of an attempt to suggest the history of the field than its current
status. Nevertheless, Amerika’s
discussion of his highly touted alt-x network indicates a possible afterlife
for hypertext in the field of publishing, suggesting that even early
applications can be adapted for newer forms.</p>
<p>Despite the outdatedness of
Amerika’s contributions to “Evolving Traditions,” it is actually Tennessee Rice
Dixon’s interview that is the greatest disappointment of the video, although it
is a disappointment lessened by the artistry of Dixon’s work itself. Like Dove and Amerika, Dixon is interested
in storytelling, and her experience as a book artist leads her to an innovative
and promising emphasis not on narrative but rather on digital technology’s
potential for assemblage and collage.  Although Dixon’s images are quite compelling, her own commentary in the
video does very little to illuminate either the ideas communicated by her work
or the particular allure of using new media in creating it.  Even the additional critical commentary by
Kathy Brew, an independent producer/curator/educator, fails to open up Dixon’s
work for the viewer.  The video profile
of Dixon does, however, show just enough of her assemblage to indicate that she
is an artist worth checking out, so those interested in finding out more should
head straight to the video website at
&lt;<a href="http://www.wigged.net/evolvingtraditions/" target="_blank">http://www. wigged. net/evolvingtraditions/</a>&gt; and follow the links to Dixon’s
online work. </p>
<p>The highlight of Thompson’s
documentary, and its most appropriate use of video as a way of demonstrating
the allure of new media productions, comes near the end in its profile of the
dance theater company Troika Ranch.  Unlike the previous three artists whose work seems rather ill-suited to
video presentation, especially in the cases where free and direct access to the
work is available online, Troika Ranch benefits from the interview format and
video presentation that allows them to explain the role of sensory technology
in their musical compositions and then to demonstrate precisely what kind of
sounds and images the technologized body might produce in a dance
production. Combining dance, musical
composition, live performance, digital visual projections, sensory technology,
and interactivity, Troika Ranch’s artistic productions are perhaps the most
suggestive of the potential new media has for evolving in new artistic
directions.  As the documentary’s final
composite of interviews suggests, disciplinary divisions among artists working
in new media have begun to break down, and several critics argue that soon even
the term “new media” will become obsolete as the designation for a specific
artistic field.  Thompson’s decision to
end his documentary with a profile of the cross-genre performances of Troika
Ranch seems to argue by demonstration that these erosions are already well
underway. </p>
<p>The difference between Troika
Ranch’s digitally mediated dance productions and the other three artists’ interactive
works is that the latter three all rely on interaction between the
audience and the digital work whereas Troika Ranch’s performance relies on
interaction between the performer and the technology with the audience as
uninvolved spectator.  Thus, while the
purpose of the video is to explore some of the different forms artistic
applications of interactive media can take, the format may seem puzzling.  Many of the works would be more
appropriately presented on CD-ROM, which would allow the audience to utilize
some of the interactive capabilities that the documentary touts.  The purpose of the video, however, is not to
give audience members hands-on experience with the works but rather to offer
them a basic introduction to a world they may never have seen, particularly if
digital media, internet art, or avant-garde venues such as The Kitchen Gallery
are not already on their maps.  In other
words, Thompson’s video, however ill-suited a medium it may seem for most of
the works it presents, is about getting people interested enough to actually
get them in the door (or portal) to explore new media art for themselves.  As a result, Thompson’s documentary is best
aimed at an audience of the uninitiated, especially for use in a high school or
college classroom. Although the video
presentation runs the risk of frustrating new media art-lovers who would much
rather interact with the works than watch others do so, and despite the limits
of the commentary in illuminating the theoretical aspects of new media art
production, “Evolving Traditions” succeeds in creating enthusiasm for the
possibilities of new media’s transformation of artistic traditions.  I suspect that many viewers who watch the
documentary will be inspired to check out new media works for themselves, not
only online but perhaps even in galleries where interactive exhibits can be
appreciated most fully.  And given my
recent lonely experience at The Kitchen, I welcome the crowds.  <img src="../../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

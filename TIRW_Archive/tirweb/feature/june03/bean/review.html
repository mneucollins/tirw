<p align="center"><b>Review of Seth Thompson's <i>Evolving
Traditions: Artists Working in New Media</i> by Heidi Bean</b></p>
<p>On a recent
trip to New York, I attended a free exhibit of interactive new media artworks
at The Kitchen Gallery. The Kitchen is
where such avant-garde artists as Laurie Anderson and Philip Glass got their
start, and the dirty, empty, slightly dodgy street it occupies creates the
sense that it is still very much on the margins of popular taste today.  After arriving at the gallery door and
identifying myself via intercom as an art appreciator and not, say, someone
looking for a warm place in off the street, I was directed to the second floor
and buzzed into the building. The
intimate black box gallery had three “interactive legends” installed: Scott Snibbe’s <i>Boundary Functions</i> (1998), Camille Utterback’s <i>Liquid Time Series</i> (2002), and Grahame Weinbren’s <i>Frames</i> (1999). Combining motion sensors, sound, and film into conceptual art and
interactive narrative, the installations were impressive and absorbing, yet the
entire time I was there, I was the sole exhibit attendee. The lack of attendance was, as it turns out,
a problem, since two of the installations required at least two participants to
fully activate their interactive capacities.  I did my best to activate the works on my own, but after an hour, I gave
up hope that another new media art-lover would appear and went home, still
without having brought one of the works to its full narrative capability.  </p>

<p>As the
emptiness of The Kitchen Gallery attests, the mounting of an exhibit of new
media “legends” notwithstanding, many people have not had even a first glimpse
of new media art.  Even for those who
are familiar with the field, the sheer variety of innovative artistic
applications of digital technology can be dizzying.  For the layperson, this vertigo is compounded by the fact that
many of the traditional methods of gate-keeping have been removed.  Websites curate their own collections,
allowing artworks to be accessed directly by users/viewers in the comfort of
their own homes.  Cross-genre approaches
that incorporate performance, video, installation, virtual reality (VR), and/or
game technology all in one work stymie attempts to locate these works of art
within existing traditions.  Nevertheless, some of the more progressive gatekeepers —such as The
Whitney in New York and San Francisco’s MoMA—have already heralded the new era
of digital art as institutionalized genre, even if it is still resisted by the
stodgier venues.  There is, it appears,
a lag in popular consciousness of new media art, and it is precisely this gap
that Seth Thompson’s new video <i>Evolving
Traditions: Artists Working in New Media</i> seeks to address. </p>
<p>Thompson’s hour-long video profiles
four selected artists “at the forefront of [the new media] renaissance”: noted
hypertext pioneer Mark Amerika; Tennessee Rice Dixon, who creates interactive
assemblages for CD and performance art; interactive and VR installation artist
Toni Dove; and the dance theater company Troika Ranch.  With footage of actual works of art as well
as interviews with the artists and with a number of curators of new media art, the
documentary offers viewers an introduction to the questions artists in a
variety of genres are asking about the potentials of the new technology and a
sense of the shifts in attitude toward its evolving capabilities.  As such, Thompson’s documentary creates an
image of new media art as both brand new and here to stay, as simultaneously
cutting edge and already an accepted part of an important and emerging
tradition in twentieth and twenty-first-century art.  Collaboration is emphasized throughout, and though the artists
are not always the most insightful critics of their own work (Dove, for
example, talks about how her video responds to audience movements but not about
what that means or why it might be desirable), the final impression is one of enthusiasm
for what new media is still in the process of becoming. <a href="review2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

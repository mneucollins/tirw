  <p align="left" class="style2">The six works presented in &quot;Oulipoems&quot;
    range from poems, to poetry games, to tools for writing poetry.
    They are inspired by the Oulipo movement, a French literary
    movement which combines writing and mathematics. Members
    of the Oulipo create works of literature that are governed
    by rules (&quot;constraints&quot;). For example, all words might have
    to contain only the vowel 'e' or words might be spelled phonetically.
    Members of the Ouliopo are also interested in algorithmically
    generated texts, including, especially, text-generating machines
    which can result in an infinite, or at least very large,
    number of different texts. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">One famous Oulipo book is Raymond
    Queneau's <em>Exercises
      de Style</em>, which is a retelling of a very banal anecdote
      in many different styles and following many different constraints.
      This directly inspired &quot;Morningside Vector Space,&quot; which
      retells a similarly banal story (based on my own experience)
      in a range of styles. The computer is central to the piece,
      however, because instead of having several static versions
      of the text, the text varies almost smoothly along two
      dimensions, controlled by the position of the mouse pointer
      in a colored square. The mathematical idea behind this
      is the notion of a vector space, in which each point (text)
      has a coordinate representing each basis vector (version
      of the text, or dimension along which the text can change).</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Several of the other pieces
    also involve modifying a text via a specialized user interface,
    to generate either a small or large number of possible texts.
    In &quot;No War,&quot; the text is on the soundtrack instead of in
    print. The mouse pointer position triggers a series of words
    in which each word has the same vowel sound but the order
    of the words is random. Some mouse positions also generate
    sound effects relating to war. The mathematics here are the
    idea of a random generator. The constraint that each word
    in a particular series must share a vowel sound is a typical
    Oulipo rule.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Sundays in the Park&quot; also involves
    variations on a text, but here, the number of texts that
    it is possible to generate is very large. The text as a whole
    has no definite meaning, but each group of words suggests
    the next by a process of punning or association. The groups
    can be displayed in several different ways, involving phonetic
    re-spellings, and the user cycles through the possibilities
    for each group by clicking on it. Phonetic spelling is
    an Oulipo procedure which was used in Queneau's book. The
    mathematics here are the combinatorics which tell you how
    many possible texts can be generated by this &quot;text machine.&quot;
    The number of possibilities for each group ranges from 2
    to 6, and there are 33 groups, so the number is between 2^33
    and 6^33 =(2^33)(3^33), so this estimate is very inexact,
    as it varies by a factor of 3^33! I leave it to the user
    to calculate the exact number of possibilities.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Headline News&quot; introduces a
    new level of complexity. This piece is an analogue of the
    Rubik's cube, only it is presented in two dimensions.
    The puzzle is in the form of a grid in which the user can
    rotate the rows and columns independently to rearrange the
    texts. The piece can be used to compose texts that one is
    interested in, or it can be viewed as a mathematical puzzle
    in which the goal is to restore the initial configuration.
    There is a lot of math in this piece: Firstly, the game board
    is topologically a torus (because you get a torus if you
    take a square and glue together the opposite sides (to get
    a tube),and then glue together the ends of the tube. Secondly,
    there is also a lot of group theory in this puzzle. Each
    position can be seen as a permutation on all the squares
    = (8)(10) = 80 squares, so the group of moves G is a subset
    of the symmetric group S_80. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">G is presumably a very complicated
    group. I have not figured out what group G is, but it has
    elements of many different orders. (In other words, there
    are moves which, if you repeat them a certain number of times,
    get you back where you started. The number of times you must
    repeat the move for this to happen is called the <em>order</em> of
      the move. Since each column has 8 elements, the move which
      rotates a column by one square has order 8. Likewise, the
      move rotating a row by one square has order 10. More complicated
      moves may have either smaller or bigger orders, depending
      on the move.) The texts themselves are alliterative (another
      constraint in the Oulipo sense of the word). By the way,
      the puzzle can always be solved. This doesn't mean that
    every arrangement of the texts is solvable (ie possible to
    manipulate so as to restore the initial configuration), but
    rather that the Scramble button scrambles by doing a series
    of legal moves, so that the moves could be undone if you
    could figure out how. I have not solved the puzzle (yet)... </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Poggle&quot; returns us to the realm
    of easier games. Poggle is a version of the game <em>Boggle</em>,
    but the tiles have fragments of poetry on them instead of
    single letters. Like <em>Boggle</em>, the player has a time
    limit in which to select as many series of adjacent tiles
    as possible. But here, the goal is to create a good poem,
    not to score points.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Finally, with &quot;The Electronic
    Muse,&quot; we are in the range of almost infinite possibilities.
    This program generates lines of poetry using the vocabularies
    of one of six different poets. The algorithm to generate
    the lines is based on the linguistics theory of Phrase Structure
    Grammar (developed by Chomsky). &quot;The Electronic Muse&quot; is
    a writing tool and not just a text generator, because the
    user can interact with it by editing the texts it generates.
    The user can also add words to the program's vocabulary.
    This piece is mathematical because of it's use of (mathematically
    inspired) linguistics. The texts it generates follow constraints
    since they use limited vocabularies and are generated according
    to rules.</p>

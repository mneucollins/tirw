<p>In the first chapter, Tabbi explains more specifically how these cognitive processes are linked to an awareness of the materiality of the text itself.  In contrast to media theorists like McLuhan and Kittler, who believe the medium itself determines the meaning of the text, Tabbi argues that the materialities of communication always remain outside of consciousness.  He similarly rejects Jameson's notion of the &quot;technological sublime&quot; as useless for resisting the structures of technology, because it ultimately brings &quot;the material substrate that constrains language and consciousness into those realms, domesticating them and making familiar what ought to remain, and does remain, irreducibly Other&quot; (19).  Therefore, rather than collapsing media and consciousness, Tabbi prefers to see the materialities of communication as simply a force that constrains consciousness.  An awareness of materiality reveals &quot;the difference between meaning and hardware,&quot; which &quot;the mind is then able to use . . . 'as a distinction,'&quot; thus enabling the jump to another conceptual level (20).  In other words, media technologies do not determine conscious experience, but rather conscious experience is produced from within the brain itself, autopoietically, and an awareness of materiality serves to foreground this &quot;self-creating process&quot; (24).</p>
<p>In chapter two, Tabbi illustrates the contrast between Jameson's &quot;technological sublime&quot; and his own notion of &quot;cognitive realism&quot; through a comparison of several novels by Thomas Pynchon.  In <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, for example, there are &quot;moments when the characters and narrator go up a level and imagine some encompassing, fully conscious, and fully fictional, 'larger Mind'&quot; (35).  According to Tabbi, this represents an attempt &quot;to dramatize a condition in which all connections and oppositions might be brought to consciousness,&quot; which remains &quot;a cognitive no less than a narrative impossibility&quot; (35).  He concludes that such an attempt reveals a remnant of humanism, which he also sees in the early cybernetic theories of Gregory Bateson.  In contrast to this approach, however, Tabbi points out that Pynchon's last two novels reflect the &quot;second-order cybernetics&quot; of Maturana and Varela, because they do not attempt to represent consciousness itself as a whole.  Instead, Tabbi argues that a novel like <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> illustrates an awareness of the very limitations of representation itself, and even when Mason senses the existence of a collective consciousness, Tabbi points out that this is merely &quot;an awareness of a repressed materiality&quot; (50).  Tabbi concludes that Pynchon &quot;seems to have come to terms with the mind's partial and contingent nature, and its necessary discovery not only within the human body, but also within the extended environment of communicative media&quot; (51).</p>
<p>In chapter three, Tabbi illustrates a similar contrast through the work of Richard Powers.  Although Powers is widely known for his practice of learning a new disciplinary field for each of his novels, Tabbi argues that this practice actually reveals an interest in systems rather than knowledge.  In other words, Powers is not simply interested in the information these fields contain, but rather in the distinctions between systems, or &quot;unsystematized experiences,&quot; which is the process of consciousness itself.  Powers' work thus repeatedly illustrates the characters' inability to know everything, and he frequently describes situations where characters are overwhelmed by vast archives of information.  Tabbi points out, however, that these situations are ultimately moments of &quot;naivet&eacute;,&quot; because they illustrate Bateson's notion of a unity of complete knowledge (67).  In contrast to this approach, Tabbi argues that a more recent novel, <i>Galatea 2.2</i>, illustrates a shift to the second-order cybernetics of Maturana and Varela, because the narrator begins to reflect on his own writing process and recognize a separation between systems of knowledge and lived experience.  Tabbi adds that this recognition is also a recognition of materiality, because consciousness itself is revealed as &quot;the constant adjustment between mental and material structurations&quot; (76).  Tabbi's conclusion to this chapter could easily serve as the central argument of the book as a whole:  <i>Cognitive Fictions</i> like <i>Galatea 2.2</i> illustrate &quot;the transition from one productive or operational mode to another,&quot; which is caused by the introduction of new information technologies (75).  They are thus occurring at a time of shifting discourse networks, and they represent a &quot;widespread cultural blockage&quot; that &quot;can only be overcome through a rearrangement or recomposition of the relations among communicating media, so that they can again be taken for granted&quot; (75).  It is this &quot;widespread cultural blockage&quot; that these authors are trying to work through.</p>
<p>In chapter four, Tabbi illustrates a similar attempt to work through blockage in Paul Auster's early novels.  As in <i>Galatea 2.2</i>, Tabbi notes that many works of <i>Cognitive Fictions</i> transform the realist novel into a journal, or a &quot;system of notations,&quot; where the correlation between &quot;collaborating minds . . . is accomplished by a <i>jump</i> between levels within a single mind&quot; (84).  Auster's early novels provide a perfect illustration of this process because they not only represent the process of cognition itself as the solitary act of writing, but they are also extremely self-reflexive; Auster, for example, frequently becomes a character in his own books, and he repeatedly illustrates the jump to a metalevel when the subject of the journal becomes the act of keeping the journal itself.  Tabbi also uses Auster's early novels to illustrate the process of &quot;re-entry,&quot; a concept he defines as &quot;a way of proceeding from blockage to a metalevel where the narration can continue&quot; (95).  In order to re-enter the system at another level, the observer must first become aware of their own role in constructing the narrative, and Tabbi adds that journals illustrate this awareness because they are &quot;differently mediated, fixed in print and posted forward for future observation in our minds and the settled minds of others&quot; (97).  A journal is therefore a &quot;remediated narrative&quot; whose power rests &quot;in a materiality that appears at the changing boundaries between print and its medial environment&quot; (97).  In other words, shifting between media enables the jump to another conceptual level, because &quot;meanings emerge that are different from what any one medium could produce in isolation&quot; (97-98).</p>

<p><b>AE:</b> If this failure of &quot;the postmodern technological aesthetic&quot; coincides with the emergence of hypertext and the Internet, you seem to be disagreeing with critics who see postmodernism as inherently linked to new information technologies. I'm thinking of Mark Poster, for example, who claims that Internet users are &quot;fragmented, dispersed, decentered, and marginalized ... in a fully postmodern sense.&quot; Do you think the term &quot;postmodern&quot; may have exhausted its usefulness as a tool of classification?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> The shift I'm talking about actually indicates the limits not of postmodernism but the enlightenment&#151;its vision of unending improvement, its belief that we can know everything through scientific progress and the<br>
reflexive understanding of our own cognition.</p>
<p>In <i>The New Yorker</i> (September 30, 2002), I'm a &quot;five-alarm avant-gardist&quot; because I once suggested that nineteenth-century realism might not be the best model for the contemporary novel, and progress toward enlightened individualism is not the only way to develop characters in fiction. Now there's a term&#151;the avant-garde&#151;that could well have outlived its usefulness because there's nothing any more to get ahead of; no accumulation of novelistic particulars, however rich and detailed, can compete with the authorized accumulations in other, more single-minded messaging systems. Maybe it's better to get behind or step to the side of progress&#151;to learn to live hypertextually in a world that is, yes, &quot;fragmented, dispersed, decentered, and marginalized.&quot; Above all marginalized, since consciousness literally can only emerge unpredictably and indirectly, alongside more powerful and more purposive media in the mind.</p>
<p>If the term, &quot;postmodernism&quot; turns up less often these days, or turns up only to be denounced, that's a sign not of irrelevance but of a project's nearing completion: full postmodernity. Raise your hand, anyone who thinks we have a choice about this? Why not accept &quot;postmodernism&quot; as the current cultural dominant, a background against which new forms of realism, consciousness, and meaning might emerge indirectly?&quot;<br>
</p>
<p><b>AE:</b> One of the arguments in your book is that these self-reflexive literary works illustrate cognitive processes partly through an awareness of their own materiality, but I was wondering if you could elaborate further on this idea. Does an awareness of materiality illustrate the process of cognition at every point, or only in isolated moments? In some cases it seems to allow narrators to make the leap to &quot;second-level observations,&quot; but does it also play a role in the process of &quot;re-entry&quot;? Is this connection stable or does it fluctuate from text to text?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> Materiality is what you have to forget in order to have narrative&#151;so no, you can't be aware of it at every point. If you think about the material supports too soon, if you are always stopping to remind yourself and your reader that everything set down on the page is a construction, the narrative won't have time to construct itself. Only in retrospect, after internal connections and worldly references have been allowed to accumulate, does it become possible to look back, to look again, and to understand that the narrative's internal organs are in fact products of organized structures in the world. That's when re-entry becomes an option. What I found happening over and over&#151;especially in the obsessive literary &quot;journalistic&quot; narratives by David Markson, Harry Mathews, Paul Auster, and Lynne Tillman&#151;is that at a certain point the accumulating connections create a structure, and that structure becomes a platform giving onto an environment that was previously invisible. </p>
<p>At the same time, re-entering the narrative can lead to a revision of its own conditions. The effect or outcome of re-entry is different in every case, but the structure is surprisingly stable across a range of different narratives, as predictable in its way as the climax to rising action in the old Freitag diagram. Instead of &quot;action,&quot; you have a building &quot;accumulation&quot; or &quot;construction&quot;&#151;to a point. After which, the backward glance is all it takes for the narrative structure to unstructure and reveal new possibilities, different ways of meaning, an alternative self-understanding. In each of these cognitive fictions, life interrupts the narrators' descriptions of it, and only then are the narrators able to revise the categories they've been using to understand their lives, what is unique to them as personalities and partial participants in systems. But they never would have reached that point of material awareness and self-understanding, if they hadn't lived and worked for a time unconsciously within an older set of constraints, under an earlier regime of realism (the informational realism of accumulating particulars). </p>
<p>I'm not pretending to break new ground here. For decades theory has taught how every insight is constituted by blindness; self-reflexivity is an acknowledged characteristic of modern narrative; and there's also the whole<br>
psychoanalytic tradition associated with the concept of <i>Nachtr&auml;glichkeit</i> that says you can only know what you are doing after you've gone ahead and done it. I'm aware of those deconstructive, metafictional, and psychoanalytical approaches but in <i>Cognitive Fictions</i> I wanted to see whether it was possible to reach the same level of narratological interest and psychological depth by citing, for example, Humberto Maturana on autopoiesis rather than Warren or Brooks or Wimsatt on the autotelic poem; Francisco Varela on second-order<br>
observation rather than Derrida on differance; Gerald Edelman on the mind's self-referring, re-entrant circuitry rather than &quot;there is no 'outside the text.'&quot; I don't say that the scientific references are superior to the literary or more exclusively philosophical references. But if the science can be used to work through the variety of literary texts I'm reading, that should at least indicate a direction that criticism can take as it tries to become more worldly, more responsive to the current cognitive environments. </p>
<p><b>AE:</b> What then do you see as the role of science in literary criticism, and why is it that the narratives you just mentioned have little to do, explicitly, with science?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> An explanation in science can never be a literary explanation or vice versa, but writers can think with similar concepts, using overlapping languages, in both literature and the sciences. A writer's conscious literary borrowings from science are not what interest me especially. If science really is culturally dominant (and not submerged by New Age scientisms or corporate technologies), its structures should reveal themselves in literary structurings, regardless of an author's conscious intentions. So this is one reason why I decided, fairly early in the project, to look at a group of highly literary writers who had interested me&#151;but only marginally&#151;for some years. After the chapters on Pynchon and Powers, who are rightly regarded as deeply informed by science, I purposely turn to less-known works by Auster, Markson, Mathews, and Tillman that have little to do with science explicitly. When Markson read an early version of the book's first chapter, he protested that he couldn't follow half the science. Even when I was citing I. A. Richards, a critic Markson had read at Columbia in the Fifties, he couldn't recognize my terms&#151;they didn't seem at all like the New Criticism he remembered&#151;I'd managed, somehow, to make Richards sound like me. Rick Powers for his part corrected me on a number of technical points, after reading an early Web version of my chapter on him. Finally, though, the book's success depends not on the science that Markson, Powers, or even I know: it's more a question of how well the science is integrated conceptually into structures whose only meaning has to be literary. <a href="interview3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<p>In chapter five, Tabbi turns to the work of David Markson, who takes this journal technique to another level by attempting to replicate in his books the way that thought itself takes form.  Tabbi begins this chapter, however, by distinguishing between these works and the modernist use of &quot;interior monologue&quot;:  Markson's novels do not attempt to represent thought itself, but rather its &quot;systems of notation.&quot;  These novels thus become collage-like assemblages, networks of information, where certain ideas or themes keep reappearing in a non-linear arrangement:  &quot;Markson's narrative begins in a condition where numerous threads coincide and no strong image of the narrator's thought emerges; what we have instead is an image of the <i>thinker thinking</i>, and of the <i>writer writing</i> before experience can be composed into a significant form&quot; (104).  Tabbi uses <i>Wittgenstein's Mistress</i> to illustrate how Markson's narratives model the process of autopoiesis.  First, the novel illustrates the elimination of the division between the self and the world by showing the narrator come to the realization that she is the last person on earth.  Second, it illustrates the self-division of the narrator, as she becomes a reader of her own narrative.  Third, it illustrates the process of re-entry by showing how the distinctions the narrator observes outside the text are brought back inside.  Although Markson's novels do not seem to provide a good example of how this jump to a metalevel is linked to an awareness of materiality, Tabbi concludes this chapter by emphasizing that this move is precipitated by the narrator's &quot;<i>look back</i> at the printed text&quot; (117), and he adds that Markson's novels also resemble hypertexts both in their collage-like structure and their interactivity.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter, Tabbi uses the work of Harry Mathews, a leading member of the Oulipo, and Stephanie Strickland, a hypertext poet, to address the impact and implications of hypertext itself.  In some ways, Tabbi has already prepared the reader for this discussion in chapter four, where he suggests that hypertexts &quot;may be considered a textual analogue of distributed cognition&quot; because they &quot;continually map an ever-shifting boundary between system and environment by filtering signal from noise&quot; (83).  In his conclusion, Tabbi reiterates this claim by pointing out that &quot;hypertext finds its nearest analogue to cognitive activity in its powers of <i>selection</i>&quot; (124).  Tabbi also adds that the genre of cognitive fiction also functions like hypertext, because it &quot;makes a frank admission of its own materiality and so establishes a ground on which authors and readers can meet as equals&quot; (130).  Mathews may seem to be a strange choice for this chapter, as his work actually follows an older print tradition; however, Tabbi suggests that Oulipian writing strategies provide a more useful context for hypertext because they similarly put the &quot;composing mind . . . into contact with formal and procedural conditions that are always present, always constraining, supporting, tweaking, and unconsciously controlling the creative process&quot; (130).  By forcing writers and readers to become aware of these constraints, hypertext (like cognitive fiction) functions as &quot;an autopoietic writing system,&quot; which &quot;draws a distinction with its environment and then folds that distinction back within itself&quot; (134).</p>
<p>Tabbi first illustrates this process using Mathews' novel <i>The Journalist</i>, which recounts the story of a man who becomes obsessed with the act of keeping a journal.  Tabbi is particularly interested in the moment when the journalist, like the narrator in <i>Galatea 2.2</i>, realizes he has forgotten to include the most important aspect of his life in his journal, which is the act of writing itself.  The narrator then makes several failed attempts to construct a &quot;journal of the journal,&quot; which eventually leads to a complete mental collapse, and he soon finds himself incarcerated in an asylum.  Tabbi adds, however, that the narrator is able to overcome this blockage at the end of the novel by engaging in a collaborative act of storytelling with an orderly:  &quot;The journalist is now poised for <i>re-entry</i> into his environment at another level, in a wholeness of interiority and exteriority and a dialogue that is not so much a communication between two people as a creation of a new narrative object outside either one of them&quot; (136).  </p>
<p>This notion of collaborative storytelling leads Tabbi into a discussion of Strickland's <i>True North</i>, a series of poems connected by hypertext links.  Tabbi begins with a close reading of the poem &quot;To Be Here as Stone Is,&quot; in which a description of light on a perfume bottle leads to a meditation on science.  Tabbi argues for a connection between Strickland's focus on surfaces and the effect of hypertext poetry itself, where &quot;the poem's surface can lead, not to hidden depths or to meanings outside the plane of language, but to the answering language on the surface of other poems, the environment or background of distinctions against which <i>this</i> poem, through selective citation, defines itself&quot; (138).  In other words, each individual poem, like a mental module, defines itself against other poems through the process of selection, and Tabbi thus concludes that hypertext &quot;resists a consciousness intent on making critical distinctions, trained to discover meanings, and hopeful of discerning authorial intentions separate from the collaborating and competing intentions of other authors in the networked environment&quot; (139).  Instead, he sees hypertext as a model of cognition itself, or rather an autopoietic system, where the material embodiment of the text becomes the means by which the distinction between system and environment is made.</p>
<p><i>Cognitive Fictions</i> contains some brilliant and insightful close readings, and Tabbi's application of cognitive science to literary works offers a level of precision that is lacking in most attempts to account for the effects of media technologies on the experience of reading.  Indeed, one of the most appealing features of this book is that it avoids the bold predictions that have become commonplace in many discussions of hypertext and instead frames electronic writing within the context of Oulipian writing strategies.  Perhaps it is a limitation of the book that this discussion only appears briefly in the conclusion, while the other chapters focus primarily on print narratives.  In fact, I was never quite persuaded by Tabbi's claim that the very marginalization of print makes it a privileged site where the effects of nonliterary media can be reproduced and critiqued (an argument which seems to justify highbrow/lowbrow distinctions).  Nevertheless, I was convinced that Tabbi's approach is useful and even necessary in discussing the effects of new information technologies on narrative, and I believe <i>Cognitive Fictions</i> marks a significant and timely contribution to this area of inquiry. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

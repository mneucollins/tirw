By Joseph Tabbi<br>

</b></p>
<p>Mary, the first technician I get on the phone, browses the Web as I, clearing papers from my desk, wait for the drivers to re-install.</p>
<p>One dot... Two dot...<br>
</p>
<p>I am rebuilding my system. Really, I am. The data is still on disks, not yet sorted into folders, file structures, and commercial interfaces, not yet touched by the mild boredom of order. I cannot access past emails without first extracting them; messages and attachments stored at different times on various platforms won't easily be recombined; drafts won't easily be merged into a single working document.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.unknownhypertext.com/" target="_blank">The Unknown</a></i>, a four-man online fiction collaborative, learned from logs and fan mail that the majority of their work is read by people <i>at</i> work.</p>
<p>It was out of boredom, mostly, that I had pressed start on the still new machine only to find that it would not boot. And with boredom, after midnight, I dialed the 1-800 number and reached India at mid-day (guessing by Mary's accent). With boredom I endured menues, entered the que, punched in the service tag number, and accepted trained assurances that 'my problem would be resolved.' First we tried to restart, and then to repair the system. It was only at the final interface, facing the same regretful DOS screen I'd gotten hours before, that I recalled in a rush what had been backed up, and what hadn't. Which essay drafts had been sent out as attachments&#151;and so preserved somewhere&#151;and which held onto and lost. Would I even know which corespondent I'd now be ignoring, which thread would not be taken up, which invitation not answered?</p>
<p>Such a person is addressing you&#151;a collector of daily emails, graphic image archives, and text file attachments more numerous than books. And if a book collection becomes, as it became for Walter Benjamin, an image of the collector&#151;what image of myself, what part of my writing life, is given in those files?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story of hypermedia, in which the Web is a recent chapter, begins with a vision of transforming the brain's associative connections into media&#151;media that can 	be infinitely duplicated and easily shared&#151;creating pathways of thought in a form that will not fade with memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking up a commission accepted before the system crash, I reset my browser proxy and again allow cookies from <a href="http://www.impermanenceagent.com/agent/" target="_blank">impermananceagent.com</a>, co-authored by Noah Wardrip-Fruin. I'd agreed, about a month ago as chance would have it, to be one of the designated browsers for the Agent's presentation at the Whitney Art Portal. My correspondence with Noah, I only just now recall, is among the missing emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Agent tells a personal story, a story of impermanence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appropriately, it is a story of lost, garbled, and nearly daily 'Error 404' messages, the fallout from cold war fantasies of world-spanning, intimately connected networks built to last. Think of the DARPA project, famously decentralized and distributed among multiple servers like so many movable weapons silos. The most profound enchantment for the systems-builder is the dream of world extension without loss. Ted Nelson's literary machines, Vannevar Bush's memex are not so far, really, from the vision of rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who thought that because 'nature does not know extinction, only transformation,' a small step in logic would prove the immortality of the human soul.</p>
<p>So much for the exploratory side of the systems-builder&#151;his eternal image, I might call it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	Would it not be presumptuous of me if in order to appear convincingly objective and down-to-earth, I enumerated for you the main sections or prize pieces of a&nbsp;library, if I presented you with their history or even their usefulnesss to a writer?</p>

<p>Consciousness cannot shake the boredom implicit in media systems; by design, consciousness is what is kept out of systems.</p>
<p>We're meant to experience <i>The Impermanence Agent</i> the way Benjamin thought architecture should be experienced: in a state of distraction. Up in the corner of my screen, a small browser window features a scrolling text. There are characters&#151;a Joan, an Anne, a Claudia; boxes of letters sent years ago to a mother, a father, a grandmother. Domestic names, workshop realism. And Zen inspired meditations on materiality and media history.(After the Agent, Noah would go on with Nick Montfort to edit a <i>New Media Reader</i>.) Images fade in and out from scanned photographs in sepia&#151;a technique I've seen before in Web writing. Childhood recollection and cultural preservation are the two poles, in this dynamic image/narrative, representing the private and the public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Agent ushers the public Web environment into our personal computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I browse the Web, I load pages into the Agent to be inserted, later, in the scrolling text; fragments of my own reading merge with the Agent's waxing and fading images.</p>
<p>A kind of metafiction, then? bringing text elements autotelically into a self-contained composition? constructing a world?</p>
<p>(Only, it's a corporate agency rather than a human agent that's doing the construction.)</p>
<p>The Agent is a storyteller, and a participant in the story being told. Hence, a self-reflexive fiction?</p>
<p>(Except that details are selected not from the world but from the programmed environment my computer provides.)</p>
<p>The slowly scrolling two-column text, almost readable at once, becomes (in the expanded version presented at the Whitney) seven columns spread out on the page, in four rows. Think of Nam-June Paik's bank of tv's showing the same program on each monitor, but at different times. Like Paik's arrangement, the Agent's layout for the Whitney dramatizes a totality that's <i>there</i>, objectively, but not capable of being grasped, cognitively. Nobody can read all these columns and rows, but the visual effect is awesome.</p>

<p>Before the crash, I thought I would approach the Agent through names and citations offered in the text. There is Bush, proposing a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	future device for individual use... a sort of mechanized private file and library;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and there is Nelson, encouraging the construction of new and more reliable forms of digital storage because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	thoughts and minds do not last.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1963, when Nelson defined the terms, hypertext and hypermedia had little to do with linking as such; connectivity was not about the maximization of research efforts, and the Internet was not meant to be a global archive of everything, ever. Nelson, it is true, imagined a medium to end all media, where everything said becomes a kind of footnote to everything else. But he also, more interestingly, proposed that a text or media object, once established in a database, could be cited in its entirety&#151;taken wholly, collaboratively, and freshly, into a new composition. Drafts on the way to a final edition could be preserved.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although my most recent notes on Nelson are gone, something I'd written on him was posted on the Web a few months ago. It was part of an Ars Electronica Anthology of Art curated by Joachim Gertz. In chain mail fashion, six Web artists and six conceptual writers would chose their twelve successors, who in turn were asked to chose the next set of twelve, and so on. All would address the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of contemporary art, what is your vision of a yet unknown art?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My answer: an art that takes responsibility for what it selects, that cites works whole, not piecemeal...</p>
<p>When I load the Anthology essay into the Agent, my words show up, machinically selected, behind the handwritten scrawl of a child's letter to Nana.</p>

<p>Full hypertextuality today is found mostly in new media arts, not in commercial transactions, not in fiction and poetry. In <a href="http://www.electronicbookreview.com/v3/servlet/ebr?command=view_essay&essay_id=reddellmsn" target="_blank">Trace Reddell's Lit-Mixer</a>, for example, which appeared as part of the MusicSoundNoise thread in <i>ebr</i>.

These works are not about media. They <i>enact</i> media in their coding and functionality, while at the same time embracing art with their purposeless purposefulness.

<p>In Texas, this morning (02-12-03), GPS devices that can be purchased at Walgreens enable recovery workers to recreate the trajectory to earth's surface taken by each shuttle fragment, back to its breakup at the vehicle's point of re-entry.

<p>What Vannevar Bush expected of the memex was not just the preservation of cultural data, but our inheritance, intact, of a data structure, what he called the </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.</p>
<p>He's speaking metaphorically, and no doubt the metaphor is misapplied to neural networks that are much more chemical than they are electronic. But we can at least be precise about what is, and what is not, capable of being preserved in organic and electronic networks.</p>
<p>In the actual brain, neural circuitry is needed for the creation of a core consciousness, a proto-self. </p>
<p>This core self, however, is not 'us,' for it is not conscious. It is not capable of forming the narratives that make 'us' what we are: beings in possession of our own life stories, selves who can feel what it's like to feel.</p>
<p>A proper analogy, then, for Bush's network and Nelson's hypertext is not the conscious mind, but this nonconscious proto-self. Incapable of narration, the proto-self is nonetheless a necessary forerunner of a conscious, autobiographical self.</p>
<p>Consciousness emerges, constrained by a collection of brain devices whose main job is the automated management of the organism's life.</p>
<p>Writing need not mimic or resist technology, if it is to emerge in electronic spaces whose main job is the automated management of corporate existence. </p>

Technical solutions are all coded now, so systems are increasingly closed to a free-ranging intelligence. We've made modules of once open networks. Maybe not in India.

<p>Resisting the dissertation, Benjamin dreamed of a work that would consist of nothing but quotations from other works. The dream of hypertext is related but different&#151;a direct material transfer of texts into one's own writing space, spread out and visible to the eye if not graspable by serial acts of attention.</p>
<p>When a text however is installed as a part of a computer's program,</p>
<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work has no visible representation at all.</p>
<p>As Geniwate <a href="http://www.electronicbookreview.com/v3/servlet/ebr?command=view_essay&essay_id=geniwatece" target="_blank">says</a> of <i>biennale.py</i>. A work she cites in contradiction of Lev Manovitch's filmic approach to electronic media.</p>
<p>No visible representation, too many interruptions for narrative pacing, less and less that's shareable, free of interference. Very little that's conducive to a sustained communication between minds.</p>
<p>Nothing can be known, as narrative, from computer codes and circuits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	The virtual as such is inaccessible to the senses. This does not, however, preclude figuring it, in the sense of constructing images of it. The appearance of the 	virtual is in the twists and folds of formed content, in the movement from one sample to another. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writes Brian Massumi (&quot;On the Superiority of the Analogue&quot;).</p>
<p>Consciousness, too, is virtual in this sense, since it only <i>emerges</i> out of the brain's topology, cells, and distributed networks. Consciousness is materially dependent on the brain but not locatable; and its products&#151;thoughts&#151;are also hard to isolate. Only in the movement from one thought to another can we experience consciousness, can we feel what it is like to have a core self and to reference that self autobiographically. </p>
<p>Maybe we move, while browsing, from one page to another. Interleavings, samples, overwrites, juxtapositions. But none of this comes&#151;none of it <i>can</i> come&#151;to narrative conciousness. Under the threshold of awareness, systems operate in microseconds. At the edges of attention, images come and go only a few of which will be selected, held on the screen for a moment's attention. Fewer still will be saved, stored, made available for future recollection.</p>
<p>Not consciousness as such, but this common ability to structure attention, over time, is the proper analogy between minds and computers. </p>
<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine what's left out, and what's left in.</p>
<p>Writes Peter Gabriel.</p>
<p>What at any moment can be <i>gone back to</i>, held in mind, worked over, remixed. What is shareable among consciousnesses separated but focused on a single object&#151;a stable text, for example.</p>
<p>The surfacing of code, the consciousness of constraint, makes demands on readers. The media fictions I've looked at call to mind how dependent I am on an entire array of technologies and institutions.</p>
<p>Until the institutions, technologies, codes, and constraints can be forgotten, however, as the conventions supporting print were forgotten with the book's naturalization, narrative's emergence is unlikely in new media environments. Designwriting, codework, the hypertextual embedding of texts within texts still require, of readers, cautious collaborations with systems designed to keep 'us' out. It's the achievement of first-generation Web fictions to show us the extent of that exclusion, the paucity of a life lived with files. These are embodied fictions, to be sure, but such an embodiment ravages consciousness by bringing its material supports to the surface.</p>

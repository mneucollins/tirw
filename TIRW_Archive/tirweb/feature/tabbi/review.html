<p>In his first book, <i>Postmodern Sublime:  Technology and American Writing from Mailer to Cyberpunk</i> (Cornell, 1995), Joseph Tabbi examined a range of postmodern and science fiction works which were responding to the complexity of the electric media environment and which expressed a simultaneous attraction to and repulsion from technology.  This book was a landmark study in the field, and it synthesized many of the theories concerning postmodernism, poststructuralism, and technology which were circulating at that time.  Tabbi has since become one of the founding editors of the <i>electronic book review</i>, and much of his editorial work over the last few years has moved away from literary representations of technology towards the concept of literature itself as simply one competing media form in a rapidly changing &quot;media ecology.&quot;  In their introduction to the anthology <i>Reading Matters:  Narrative in the New Media Ecology</i> (Cornell, 1997), for example, Tabbi and Michael Wutz describe the early twentieth century as a time when print narratives were forced to compete with new media, such as gramophones and kinetoscopes, and they note that some modernist writers responded to this competition &quot;by assembling congeries of facts, figures, and data streams that, in their self-conscious overabundance, were presumed to be uncontainable by these newer media.&quot;  Tabbi and Wutz add that such an approach has now become particularly urgent as new information technologies, such as hypertext and hypermedia, promise to transform the act of writing and reading so dramatically that they force critics to reconsider the form and function of the book in new ways.</p>
<p><i>Cognitive Fictions</i> also addresses the effects of information technologies on contemporary American fiction, and thus it is clearly a continuation of this project; however, it also contributes to a growing body of work which is attempting to account for the ways in which communications technologies and cognitive models are beginning to merge.  Friedrich Kittler's work, for example, has been a sustained attempt to identify the intersections between media technologies and theories of the unconscious, and the more recent work by John Johnston has even defined consciousness as a &quot;reading effect&quot; determined by the culture's capacity to store acoustic, optical, and written information.  Tabbi intervenes in these debates by using contemporary cognitive science and systems theory to understand the impact of information technologies on contemporary American fiction.  While this project might surprise readers who were expecting a study focused more exclusively on hypertext, Tabbi uses cognitive science as a way of understanding what happens in the act of reading, and thus the issues surrounding hypertext become part of a larger discussion about the impact of materiality itself on conscious experience.</p>
<p>In his introduction, Tabbi describes a general trend in contemporary fiction, which he describes as a new kind of self-reflexivity and self-awareness inspired by the media environment in which these novels are forced to compete.  Tabbi points out, however, that these works do not represent the functioning of consciousness itself in the modernist style of &quot;stream of consciousness,&quot; but rather they expose and critique the systems of notation through which thoughts themselves are recorded:  &quot;What happens in this set of remarkable novels . . . is that a notation system reaches a level of complexity that can no longer be sustained by the narrator, and so the narrator jumps . . . to a different conceptual level&quot; (xxii).  Tabbi adds that this jump is not produced by making &quot;a distinction between the inside and outside&quot; of the text, but rather &quot;by imagining oneself as 'outside,' the observer introduces a new distinction within the writing-system,&quot; which allows the system to &quot;function differently within the environment&quot; (xxii).  Tabbi describes this as the process of &quot;autopoiesis,&quot; a term coined by the life scientists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, which he defines as &quot;a way of establishing and maintaining a system's boundary by selecting meaningful elements (distinctions the system can use) out of an otherwise indistinct, 'noisy,' environment&quot; (xxiii).  Autopoiesis is essentially the process of cognition, Tabbi adds, because it is the same process the mind performs in generating a sense of self out of the various mental modules and reentrant circuits in the brain.  Tabbi adds that the works he has chosen to discuss in this book similarly perform this process by illustrating a level of complexity that cannot be sustained, leading the narrators to make a jump to another level where they observe new distinctions which are then incorporated back into the system, allowing it to move to another level of complexity. <a href="review2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

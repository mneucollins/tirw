<p><b>Anthony Enns:</b> How is this book a departure from your previous work? In some ways it doesn't seem that far removed from <i>Postmodern Sublime</i>, but in your introduction you draw a clear line between &quot;the postmodern technological aesthetic&quot; and contemporary works of &quot;cognitive realism.&quot; What exactly is this distinction?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Tabbi:</b> In <i><i>Postmodern Sublime</i> </i>I had the idea, maybe from an overheated reading of Thomas Pynchon, that resistance to technology was possible, and the way to go about resisting was through critique. Pynchon's Schwartzcommando, Black militants of the Counterforce, spoke to a literary generation that was moving en masse from textual into cultural criticism: &quot;We have to look for power sources here, and distribution networks we were never taught, routes of power our teachers never imagined, or were encouraged to avoid....&quot; If &quot;we,&quot; the disempowered through whom power nonetheless flows, could get our hands on enough information, measure feedback, and skeptically read through the artificial constructs of Western print culture, that would produce the &quot;real Text.&quot; What was written could be unwritten, what was culturally constructed could be reconstructed, and the ground would be set for the emergence of an alternative, subaltern, postcolonial, and postmodern culture.</p>
<p>To some extent, this has happened. Criticism is, on the whole, better informed now, and literary institutions by and large are more inclusive. But all the consciousness raising of the Eighties and Nineties hasn't helped anyone, within or without power, come to grips with technology. Critique has managed, at best, to accompany technology into ever more specialized areas formerly given exclusively to culture. Cultural critics can name technology's effects, we can take the material complexification of the universe into a symbolic register. But this way of handling technology, in terms familiar to a language-based discipline, is largely a &quot;domestication,&quot; in Mark Hansen's words, a narrowly literary activity filled with false reassurances.</p>
<p>As an engineering major in the eighties I knew more about technology than literature and I was well aware of the disconnect. But instead of honing close to the language of scientists and engineers&#151;a language I understood and appreciated&#151;I tried to explore technologies through the language of a still emerging cultural studies. What a massive post-graduate effort that became! And it was only partially successful, finally. Hanjo Berressem's early evaluation of <i><i>Postmodern Sublime</i></i> turns out to have been the most accurate: good on the technology, weak on the sublimities.</p>
<p>But still I was attracted to the sublime as a critical conceit, perhaps because it gave a romantic veneer to linguistic and symbolic failure. The sublime is a figure for what cannot be figured symbolically, the place where critique stops and you can stop resisting, you give in, enjoy your symptom (as Slavoj Zizek said). Fredric Jameson thought that by creating better, more fine-grained cognitive maps, political activism and &quot;critical effectivity&quot; could be re-awakened, collective Agency would settle new territories, and technology would be put securely in its place, as a material &quot;effect&quot; of signification. A similar ambition characterizes the novelists I was reading for the book&#151;Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Norman Mailer, Joseph McElroy, Kathy Acker, and the cyberpunks who for a brief moment in the mid-Eighties seemed poised to regenerate the postmodern technological aesthetic. The novelist's language may have been more subtle than the theorist's, and novelistic structures were not so explicitly dependent on a Marxist or Lacanian or Foucauldian framework, but the literary aesthetic project was pretty much consistent with, and ahead of, the cultural theory of the time: both were about resisting technology through discourse.</p>
<p><b>AE:</b> And that resistance has proven futile?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> Maybe it's a case of scratching where it doesn't itch, although the technological itch is real and persistent; it's not going to be lessened by critique.</p>
<p>In retrospect I see <i>Postmodern Sublime</i> as a book documenting the failed domestication of technology into language, in a small body of distinctly American writing that is at once over-reaching and wonderful but momentary, and without followers. William Vollmann, David Foster Wallace, Rick Powers, and even DeLillo after <i>The Names</i> have all been working a different vein really, toward a fiction that no longer tries to bring the entire proliferating material world into language and consciousness. What is realistic about &quot;cognitive realism&quot; is its recognition that the vast majority of cognitive activity is unconscious, semi-autonomous, irreducible to a literary standard. But recognizing this makes the work more, not less, interesting <i>as literature</i>. Other, faster and more comprehensively sense-driven media can handle the symbolic register far more effectively than a traditionally realistic novel&#151;with its elaborately 'drawn' settings, visual, aural, and sonic invocations, or surreal landscapes that may have anticipated film, sound recording, and photography but which have since been obviated by these same media. Before film and the gramophone, a reader capable of forgetting the materiality of print on a page could reasonably be expected to imagine these other registers in the privacy and solitude of reading, and to find enjoyment in doing so. Now, with the Imaginary made explicit and public and externalized on screens, there's no need for such a detour through print. So as readers we can focus again on what's there before our eyes: namely, printed words. <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

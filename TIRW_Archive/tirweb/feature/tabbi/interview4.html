<p><b>AE:</b> Have you ever used electronic media for your own scholarship, or did you consider constructing a web-based version of this book?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> In 1995, when the word hypertext was making its way from Ted Nelson's speculative writing into the academic mainstream, I wrote an essay, &quot;Hypertext Hotel Lautreamont,&quot; in what I took to be a properly hypertextual mode, one that did not literally install unmotivated electronic links among neutrally referenced texts but which brought the texts into a single field, where they actually could be held together in the mind of a reader, compared, and navigated freely not despite print's constraints but rather <i>because</i> of them: the linked concepts needed to be <i>gone back to</i>, read again, reconsidered in light of the development of a particular argument. The <i>Hypertext Hotel </i>collaboration initiated by Robert Coover, John Ashberry's vilanelle, &quot;Hotel Lautreamont,&quot; and Lautreamont's own fevered speculations through maxims, one-liners, perverse parables&#151;these were my texts, chosen for conceptual affinities that might as well be brought out, I thought, by the arbitrary repetition of a single word or phrase as by any &quot;linear&quot; mode of argument. Still, I didn't give up on the idea of argument altogether&#151;to the contrary, what I liked in Lautreamont was his insistence on arguing vehemently through a selection of citations and expressions that are themselves often fragmentary, inconsistent, perverse or paradoxical, and never wholly possessed by the author whose commitments are to the composition not to the content of any single utterance. In the course of the essay, I would let that chosen word or phrase, repeated from one paragraph to the next, do the work of conceptual linking. (Coover I found used a similar technique in his short story, &quot;The Babysitter,&quot; so I threw in that text and made it the occasion for a hypertextual excursion into old-fashioned literary close reading.) </p>
<p>That essay appeared in a special issue of <i>SubStance</i> titled&quot;Metamorphoses of the Book&quot; (published in 1997), and I've remained true to the idea that the effect of an emergent writing technology is to transform rather than displace the book and literary narrative as the primary media of collective cognition, a living archive and the race's high-level genome. If I do have a thesis, as I thought I did in <i>Cognitive Fictions,</i> the book remains at present the best medium for conveying it, for enabling the back-and-forth, conceptual work that a reader must do in order to understand the thesis, follow its variations, and react either by counter-argument or with alternative creativity. The as yet static nature of HTML links, and the unavailability of a single, standard way of tracking links conceptually in a Web environment (as opposed to powerful but specific software such as Eastgate's Storyspace), kept me thinking along lines given by the printed page. It's possible, of course, that the move away from HTML to XML will help writers to realize the kinds of conceptual linking, tracking, and organization that for Nelson was always the promise of hypertext. I'm currently working with a programmer, Ewan Branda, on an application that uses XML and MySQL database technology toward precisely these ends, and I'll be presenting the results to a group of scholar/critics in the Electronic Literature Organization&#151;the committee for Preservation, Dissemination, and Archiving&#151;interested in determining what technical standards will be conducive to specifically literary innovation in electronic environments. Once we've sorted that out, if such sorting is possible in the current culture of proprietary software and incompatible platforms, I could easily get from the publisher the latest e-version of <i>Cognitive Fictions</i> and try coding its paragraphs, keywords, and conceptual threads according to an XML schema. But I doubt it. Once I've finished a project, I find it difficult&#151;almost <i>physically</i> impossible&#151;to go back to it, except maybe for a reference. </p>
<p><b>AE:</b> By addressing the connections between technology, embodiment, and cognitive processes, this book also appears to be a contribution to the field of posthumanist studies, although I'm not sure exactly which version of posthumanist subjectivity you would ultimately subscribe to. Works of cognitive realism, for example, reject the notion of the liberal humanist subject by dismissing narrative &quot;voice,&quot; yet you seem to avoid using the term &quot;posthuman.&quot; How would you characterize your position on this topic?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> I do avoid the term, yes&#151;because I don't see what concepts or what particulars the term helps one to grasp. Like everybody, I bought and read Kate Hayles's book on becoming posthuman the moment it appeared and I return to it all the time but more for its history of cybernetics and cognitive theory (historical chapters interspersed with close readings of distinctive contemporary fictions) than for its promotion of a term, 'the posthuman,' that seems only to organize all the other 'posts' and 'ends' of this and that. The critique of human<i>ism</i> is already formulated in modern and postmodern theory so there's not much more for posthumanism to do on that front. But I'm not even convinced that conceptual innovation is the goal here. If anything, as conceptual writing, books and articles on the posthuman rely quite heavily on notions of &quot;voice,&quot; analysis, and forthright story-telling from a particular, self-enclosed, consciously situated subject position&#151;very conventional and teachable notions which I do find regressive, yes. Apart from one famous sentence in Foucault about humanity's outlines being erased like a sketch in the sand, all that gives force to the posthuman is the widespread belated but still unwilling recognition that technology has made cyborgs of us all&#151;that and certain reckless experiments with human genetics. </p>
<p>The conceptual writing that interests me most, what I would like to see represented in any cognitive approach to literary study, recognizes the priority of a non-human, bodily, non-conscious, at once prosthetic and essentially natural existence that both enables and constrains consciousness. A certain refusal to domesticate nature and technology as so much further &quot;discourse&quot; energizes the best work in systems theory, cognition, and the materialities of communication; it's what pushes eco-criticism beyond thematic appreciations of  'the environment' to sympathetic participation in natural and medial ecologies. It's also what underlies Derrida's reflection that &quot;I,Too, Am An Animal&quot; and Cary Wolfe's unique convergence of deconstruction, American pragmatism, and cognitive science in <i>Critical Environments</i> and <i>Animal Rites</i>. Brian Massumi's <i>Parables for the Virtual</i>, by resolutely refusing to <i>apply</i> concepts, might serve as an antidote to the deadening, normative approaches to cognition (what Francisco Varela calls &quot;cognitivist&quot; thinking); Detailed readings from within the Darwinian tradition (a tradition that is itself always evolving) by Elisabeth Gross, Vicki Hearn, and Geoff Winthrop-Young avoid the fallacies of evolutionary psychology&#151;whose popularizers too often explain away all of behavior by fanciful narratives of evolved human nature unsupported by a partial geological record. Laura Marks writing on &quot;touch,&quot; down to the way electrons remember, can help to reawaken the libidinal dimension so crucial to the practice of close reading, close watching, intersubjective attentiveness. I'm very aware of the meanness with which such terms as &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;evolution&quot; are often invoked in the context of a worldwide market economy, but that abuse doesn't mean that the body is determined <i>entirely</i> by discourse. To be accused of &quot;essentializing&quot; is not the worst fate for a critic working to bring about a convergence of science and literature. </p>
<p><b>AE:</b> Where do you see your work going from here? Do you have any other projects in mind?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> Once at a conference the moderator, a Lacanian, impressed me when suddenly he ended a post-panel discussion in full swing by saying that sometimes the hardest and most productive thing to do, in conversation, is to stop talking. I happened to have been the last speaker and maybe I still had more words in mind but I took this interruption (after giving it some thought) not as an affront but rather as a practical encouragement to trust one's listeners, and one's readers, actually to listen and read and respond in their own good time. </p>
<p>There's an incredible over-production of scholarship largely unread but encouraged, no doubt, by the ease of electronic dissemination and the sheer capacity for storage (if not organization) in administrator inboxes and departmental files. But that bulwarked system of reception, for academic writing, comes with a diminished sense of the reality of an audience. It's as if an entire cadre of critical professionals had internalized Joyce's ideal insomniac reader when in reality nobody is capable, physically, of working through the mass of diverse materials let alone drawing significant connections. It's a challenge for anyone who has written a book simply to trust in the reality of readers, and not immediately to go running after the book with explanations, clarifications, conference appearances, follow-up articles, college courses, colloquia, and sequels. </p>
<p>At the moment I don't have another book project in mind or even an article idea but I do want to keep on working, in collaboration with Mark Amerika, Anne Burdick, and Ewan Branda, on the <i>electronic book review</i> interface and database architecture; and I want to work through the Electronic Literature Organization to make sure that the <i>ebr</i> results are scaleable. Once that's established (and the XML schema development has been under way for several years, longer than it took me on my own to write <i>Cognitive Fictions</i>), I'll have a working Web environment, custom-made, within which to remediate my critical practice. By then, too, <i>ebr,</i> ALTX, the ELO, <i>C-theory, Rhizome, Nettime, Postmodern Culture, The Voice of the Shuttle, The Iowa Web, Beehive </i>and dozens of other sites may have created, through our various slow and patient efforts, a sensibility for conceptual writing on the Web. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"><br>

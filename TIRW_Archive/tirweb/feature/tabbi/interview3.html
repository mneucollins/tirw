<p><b>AE:</b> You also argue that this connection between cognition and materiality can be observed at another level by conceiving of literature itself as the consciousness of &quot;the new medial ecology&quot; because it is capable of &quot;registering and reproducing&quot; the effects of other media. But why are non-literary media less capable of registering and reproducing these effects, and why have you chosen to focus primarily on print narratives?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> I know: it sounds suspiciously like dancing about architecture&#151;reading print narratives for insights into electronic media. Sometimes I'm reminded of the scam music man (played by who was it? Robert Preston?) in the old Hollywood film, who tells his students to hold the instrument, get the feel of it, but by no means should they attempt to play a note. Even as a kid watching that movie, I thought there was more wisdom than charlatanism in the music man. </p>
<p>The great strength and great limitation of non-literary media is that they communicate directly through the senses, without having to detour through representational language, through the secondary materiality of the printed word. That means non-literary media can communicate faster; they demand less reflection on the part of an audience. Unlike the book, which is by design self-standing and separate from other media, a digital text can exist on the same platform as the sounds, sights, and tangible contact it is about. So the digital text remains open to all sorts of interruptions that would defeat the book; especially online, where reading does not so much allow as require multi-tasking. All of this&#151;speed, interruptibility, an electronic materiality&#151;makes non-literary media resemble mental modules, the non-verbal, non-conscious, on-again off-again circuitry in the brain that accounts for the vast majority of cognitive processes. The modules, like the media, are kept too busy to get beyond themselves. It isn't at the modular level that the mind stops and reflects; rather, it's only through combinations of multiple modules and re-entrant circuits that a conscious thought comes into being and then gets replaced by a different thought, in a series that is amenable to analogue processing and narrative structuring.</p>
<p>Artists and writers working in non-literary media and the entertainment industry may be very conscious of what they want to achieve, the effects they want to bring about. Mass media hipsters can even employ postmodern techniques so as to be self-conscious with respect to audience expectations and the medium's own history. But the pressure to produce reportable results, to get a definite response from an identifiable audience, and to commodify every keystroke, keeps things at a fairly low cognitive level, closer to modular perception than conscious reflection. For an understanding of medial effects, it's better to move to another, slower medium that has developed specific techniques, in parallel to the development of mass media during modern times, of reflection and transformation into narrative. That's why I prefer &quot;experimental,&quot; highly literary, narratives to conventional or so-called realistic stories. Not for aesthetic reasons alone. It's more a question of functional differentiation. The book settles into its niche, finds its specific powers, only by doing what cannot be easily done elsewhere, in other media. </p>
<p><b>AE:</b> This distinction between literary and non-literary media seems to echo the old Frankfurt School concepts of absorption and distraction, although you're clearly privileging the former over the latter. Are you suggesting these experimental narratives thus represent a kind of resistance to new information technologies, like hypertext, by offering a more active, contemplative reading experience?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> Here too, I'm happy to echo the Frankfurt School since I'm not trying to surpass or trash established modes of literary or cultural writing. The Marxist, Psychoanalytic, and Deconstructive Schools represent solid achievements that should not be discarded or made irrelevant simply because entertainment and pop culture, what used to be considered &quot;trash,&quot; are now pillars of the dominant culture, capable of making any form of social criticism or conceptual writing appear irrelevant or dated. If conceptual writing is to survive in cognitive and technological environments that are, I think, authentically new, such writing will have to <i>resituate</i> past achievements. To ignore them or attack their high cultural pretentions only emphasizes what is most destructive about mechanized pop culture, its impatience with any thinking or expression that delays the gratification of individual desire. </p>
<p>That said, I do think that the Frankfurt School's emphasis on resistance and critique will be less forceful, will continue to lose purchase even if the perfectly valid distinction between absorption and distraction takes hold in a cognitive framework. Brain scientists and cognitive psychologists may not know yet&#151;it's possible they never will know&#151;how consciousness emerges from its material supports and God only knows its purpose. But its main activity, once consciousness does emerge, is surely not to <i>critique</i> the more powerful, modular arrangements that give it birth. What consciousness more urgently does is to keep itself going by making selections from all the billions of possible states that the brain makes available, deciding what thought out of all the possible thoughts, and which memory out of all possible memories, comes next. Observation and selection, then, not critique and resistance, are the powers worthy of cultivation within cognitive environments.</p>
<p><b>AE:</b> By discussing hypertext in terms of Oulipian writing strategies, you also seem to situate it within an older narrative tradition. How would you characterize your position on electronic writing in relation to other critics?</p>
<p><b>JT:</b> The Oulipo is another, more practical but equally literary, tradition with much to offer writers who are thinking of moving out of one set of constraints&#151;those associated with print&#151;into another set associated with branching, digital narratives that are capable of delegating certain powers of selection to the reader. How these differing constraints are consciously regarded, unconsciously bumped up against, embraced or resisted, and what narrative possibilities writers discover in the process&#151;all this seems way more exciting to me than sterile debates about whether the new writing should be called hypertext or cybertext, or whether games as such should be the model for electronic textuality. The programmatic constraints identified by Espen Aarseth&#151;singling out film or print as two among what is it, 575 possible audiovisual presentations in a full-on Web environment? Such literal-minded analysis not only risks succumbing to technological determinism&#151;evident in some of Aarseth's followers. The cybertext program more generally falls into the trap of placing too much front-brain faith in our ability to manipulate the expressive possibilities within a given set of technologies, printed or electronic.</p>
<p>The difference between Oulipian and cybertextual writing strategies is the difference between the procedural and the programmatic. One has to do with composition, which is internal and cognitive; the other has only to do with communicability and programmability, about what messages can be sent through which channels. Cybertext theory is discourse about what is possible; Oulipian writing, by contrast, is about potential, as the French acronym, &quot;literature potentielle&quot; suggests. The Oulipian writer willingly accepts constraints on what is possible in order to have a chance at writing what was hitherto unthinkable. Writing without the letter &quot;e,&quot;to cite the most famous experiment conducted at novel length by Georges Perec, in itself is a sure way of producing sentences and expressions that would never have occurred to an unconstrained writer, however many sign-making mechanisms in however many different media that writer has at his or her disposal.</p>
<p>This idea of actively writing under constraint, that a literary generation has the chance to record the surprise and fascination of encountering formerly repressed material conditions as new obstacles and new opportunities, is for me the promise of writing in electronic environments. If other theorists want to play computer games and debate terminology, I'll listen and learn but nothing will convince me that what's exciting about the new media are the entirely programmatic, mechanized forms of writing that computers are capable of automating. <a href="interview4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

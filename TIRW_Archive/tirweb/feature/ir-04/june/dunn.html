        <p class="iareview">That red gash in the hills, I told her,<br>
          is bauxite, not clay. I saw that it was <i>gash</i><br>
          that made her smile. What about <br>
          those cows the color of Irish Setters <br>
          grazing in the lowland? she asked.<br>
          Oh, just big, slow dogs.<br>
          Thank you, she replied, like Elvis,<br>
          thank you very much. <br>
          That over there, I said, feeling it now,<br>
          is bougainvillea, and see, up the trail, <br>
          that house, the one gutted by fire?<br>
          It once belonged to a famous bandit<br>
          and his high maintenance woman, <br>
          dear friends of mine.<br>
          I like the word <i>cornucopia</i>, she said,<br>
          the sound and size of it,<br>
          that's the kind of girl I am.<br>
          I understand, I didn't say.<br>
          Instead I told her that beyond<br>
          the red gash in the hills<br>
          are the caves, and beyond the caves<br>
          are the monasteries beyond sleep<br>
          where you get to lie down.<br>
          Good, she said, we're getting places now.</p>

          <br>
          <i>March 16, 2003</i></p>
        <p class="iareview">On TV the showbiz of war,<br>
          so I turn it off<br>
          wishing I could turn it off,<br>
          and glance at the five white roses<br>
          in front of the mirror on the mantel,<br>
          looking like ten.<br>
          That they were purchased out of love<br>
          and are not bloody red <br>
          won't change a goddamned thing--<br>
          goddamned things, it seems, multiplying<br>
          every day. Last night<br>
          the roses numbered six, but she chose<br>
          to wear one in her hair,<br>
          and she was more beautiful<br>
          because she believed she was.<br>
          It changed the night a little.<br>
          For us, I mean. </p>

        <p class="iareview"><b>Postcard from Tortola</b></p>
        <p class="iareview">I've never been to Tortola,<br>
          though many times I've drifted<br>
          to the vast principality of elsewhere<br>
          where, no doubt, a Tortola must be,<br>
          so I can attest the weather is the weather<br>
          I've brought with me, overcast<br>
          with periods of sun, always a low<br>
          following a high, and the natives<br>
          impoverished and gay. You wouldn't<br>
          like it here. Go elsewhere. One person's<br>
          Tortola is another's Sadness-by-the-Sea.<br>
          The duty from which you're absolved<br>
          in the duty-free shops comes with a price.<br>
          On the other hand, it's beautiful--<br>
          the water turquoise, the breeze a constant<br>
          caress. Some people actually love<br>
          that there's singing in the streets.</p>

        <p class="iareview"><b>The Past</b></p>
        <p class="iareview">The corpses wait under my bed<br>
          as if not quite bony enough<br>
          for the closet, already so full.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Whatever in life they were deprived of<br>
          they claim as their own.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Between the bed and the closet:<br>
          all those without final residence,<br>
          hovering.</p>
        <p class="iareview">On the floor the things a broom<br>
          is trying to sweep<br>
          under the rug,</p>
        <p class="iareview">but they, too, just rise<br>
          into the air, stay.</p>
        <p class="iareview">And the writing on the wall--<br>
          how suddenly contemptible<br>
          the visible seems.</p>
        <p class="iareview">The future's here.<br>
          Even when I wake it doesn't go away.</p>

        <p class="iareview"><b>Suspension (April 20, 1984)</b></p>
        <p class="iareview"><br>
          The world's most astonishing photograph shows my sixth birthday party, 
          with five children gathered at a picnic table, staring at a bomb. In 
          the background, my grandfather's hands rest on his bald head, and my 
          father stares at the sky. Far above them, unseen by anyone but the camera, 
          my sister is flying.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Five minutes later, my mother would come out with 
          chocolate cupcakes. She would take the bomb away and put it inside the 
          family room, which convinced us all that the house would blow up in 
          seconds.</p>
        <p class="iareview">About three minutes earlier, my father had handed 
          his camera to my mother. The other photos on the roll are his. </p>
        <p class="iareview">Ten minutes later, the sky would crack open with dark 
          thunder as we all ran screaming for the house. My sister, underwater 
          in the pool, at first did not notice the slicing rain.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Fourteen years later, I would find, in the same roll 
          as this picture, five photographs my father took of a woman with red 
          hair, the sunlight shining through a hotel window on her face, a sheet 
          wrapped around her chest. The photo envelope was marked in my mother's 
          penciled writing: &quot;Steven's roll: B's 6th B-day party, Easter, 
          etc.&quot; I took the five etceteras and stuck them in a white envelope, 
          storing them in my desk for the next five years, in case I ever needed 
          to blackmail him.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Exactly six years before the picture was taken, I 
          came out screaming, the umbilical cord wound three times around my neck 
          as if I'd tried to hang myself rather than be born. Somehow, I was still 
          breathing.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Seven years and eight months later, my grandfather, 
          my father's father, living in Hawaii, would call to joke about the time 
          difference. &quot;Happy new year!&quot; he cried. &quot;I'm calling 
          from the old year! Tell me, what is the future like?&quot;</p>
        <p class="iareview">Thirteen years after the picture was taken, when my 
          sister was in her thirty-ninth hour of labor, I would light a votive 
          for her in Ely Cathedral because, although I didn't believe in anything 
          like that, she did. I remembered the picture, how her twelve-year-old 
          body flew through the air, her black hair straight out behind her. </p>
        <p class="iareview">Ten minutes before the picture, the air had started 
          to get thick with humidity, so that my grandfather, his lungs old and 
          weak, had to elevate his arms in order to get enough breath.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Twenty years later, looking at this picture and forgetting 
          the thunderstorm looming overhead, I would wonder if it was the memory 
          of a bomb that made my father turn his face to the sky, where the bombs 
          of his childhood had been born. He stands there, hands on hips, squinting, 
          as if waiting for a message.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Less than one year later, I would take my first photograph, 
          a color Polaroid of my grandfather standing on his head in his Honolulu 
          apartment. He wore a red and green Hawaiian shirt and his legs were 
          lotus-folded in the air. He would stay like that for another hour, maybe.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Eighteen years later, sorting through the shoebox 
          of photo envelopes, my mother would (oddly) not seem to notice anything 
          missing from this roll.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Two minutes before the photo was taken, I had unwrapped 
          David Schlosberg's present, a black plastic ball with a thick white 
          string sticking out, cartoon-style. &quot;It's a <i>real bomb</i>,&quot; 
          he said. &quot;<i>Not</i> a toy. It'll blow up in about, like, two minutes.&quot; 
          So we put it on the table and waited.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Less than a second before, my sister had bounced up 
          and out, impossibly far, from the neighbor's diving board, one backyard 
          behind ours. Her black swimsuit and the water trapped in its thick weave 
          gleamed in the one-o'clock sun, her arms out straight, her feet pointed 
          behind her. She would belly-flop, but as the picture is snapped, it 
          looks for all the world like she's flying and won't ever come down.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Fifty years before this photograph, my grandfather 
          had posed for another picture, one that is now on my father's bookshelf. 
          It is 1934, and he is wearing the uniform of the parliament of Hungary. 
          The sword at his side and the double row of gold buttons up his coat 
          make him look like Napoleon. On his lapel are rows of medals and pins, 
          gifts from foreign embassies and dignitaries in exchange for favors, 
          courtesies. Although you cannot see its brilliant red color in the black 
          and white photo, one small pin has at its center the twisted arms of 
          a swastika, a gift from Germany's new chancellor. </p>
        <p class="iareview">Six years and three hours earlier, I started to push 
          my way out. My mother could not get up to change the channel on the 
          hospital-room TV away from the NBC retrospective on Hitler (the 89th 
          anniversary of his birth that day), and the Jewish woman in the next 
          bed, although she did not want to watch it either, could not get up 
          because she was sitting Shiva for her brother. My father came in and 
          slammed the power button with his palm. </p>
        <p class="iareview">Nineteen years later, I would shred and throw away 
          the photos of the red-haired woman, realizing as I did so that she was 
          quite beautiful.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Forty years earlier, held in a Budapest jail cell 
          for public resistance to the Third Reich, my grandfather learned yoga 
          from a shot-down RAF pilot named Nigel, who had grown up in India during 
          the Raj. They closed their eyes and, as the bombs rained down and cast 
          light through the small, unreachable windows, tried to levitate.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Six years, nine months, and sixteen days earlier, 
          I settled, suspended, in the amniotic pool. I would spend more than 
          two extra weeks there, breathing liquid and floating.</p>
        <p class="iareview">Ten years after the photograph, another call from 
          Hawaii, my grandfather either joking or confused: &quot;Which happened 
          first for you?&quot; he almost shouted into the phone. &quot;The sunrise 
          or the sunset? It is very important that I know!&quot; He sounded like 
          he was choking.</p>
        <p><span class="iareview">In two seconds, my sister would hit the water. 
          My father's head would turn at the sound of the splash.<br>
          An hour later, after my friends had gone home, I would put the bomb 
          in my room, and spend the next few days half-waiting for it to explode.

        <p>Hindsight sheds light at the end of our preposterous tunnel-of-love: 
          I see you, elbows prop-<br>
          ped on the bar, hunched and haunched, clich&eacute;d as the cigarette 
          you nurse; or, with the car,<br>
          braked, your walking for news, crunch-crushing the snow with your boots. 
          These snatches<br>
          backlash me to the woman I was, someone other than the woman I've become 
          in the wake<br>
          of my tenure with you. Ghosts of another haunted-house muse: myself, 
          a figure in black<br>
          and blue. You, &quot;pragmatical,&quot; left me by the side of the road, 
          neatly labelled<i>--refuse--</i><br>
          What does it mean to refuse? A disposable razor slits the battered bulb 
          of my breast.<br>
          A pocket peers: could my anger sit long enough for its portrait? Stuck 
          in the rut of what<br>
          we called love, calling our own, or my own, bluff once too often, I 
          grew less and less sure<br>
          of who.... I am the object of your indecision, your tedium, item overdue, 
          a favored, but finally,<br>
          worn-out shoe. Ambivalence's epitome: look for the emotion and you'll 
          find me. In the pit<br>
          of my stomach. I cannot breathe. I squandered myself. In my efforts 
          to please. I left someone<br>
          I was in the process of learning to become. Can I remember her, reformat? 
          Stop my fears,<br>
          fingers sticky with the gash of this, my shaky, unfinished business? 
          I am: nothing in the greater<br>
          scheme of things, an unfortunate marble stuck in the sink, wholly of 
          the fantasy <i>Once upon<br>
          a time you loved me</i>. From beginning to end, I loved and lost, was 
          double-crossed. By myself.<br>
          By you. Kept on the band of a watch for a hand that couldn't decide 
          whether or not to hold<br>
          mine. The houseguests have departed, the dishes are stacked, your conversion 
          narrative me-tastasizes my excess grief into rage. Infuriation strikes, 
          a kindling. Unable to defrost my hands,<br>
          my feet, my tongue's especially resistant to remeet my self half-way: 
          alien, bulbous, callous <br>
          as coal. Unable to sit and/or stand, I hole up in an ill-formed night 
          that sweats, my body, <br>
          hunchbacking a fecal mass, force-entered and hemorrhaging from every 
          orifice. Combustible, <br>
          stubborn as sin. Talking a cure with no one to listen, I melt in your 
          mouth to begin exactly <br>
          where I left off: <i>What's wrong with me? What crack did you see that 
          was too much? </i>Nothing <br>
          and everything rhymes with love and shit, this hollowness, a lack of 
          verb. All passion and <br>
          passive and prone to obey, I disgust myself with what I said and say.<i> 
          Do you like my face? <br>
          I wasn't enough, wasn't worthy of your love</i>. Some heat-shiver fancy 
          on the way to someone <br>
          bigger and better, more complicated, new, I was a little town you were 
          passing through. Some-<br>
          thing you stopped in for the novelty. Something you thought you could 
          sightsee. A speck on <br>
          the map. A footnote in your larger plan of naming states for the sake 
          of a grander tour of <br>
          yourself. I know the crossroads. I memorized them, like a good girlfriend. 
          I know my own<br>
          backhanded woes. What you saw in me as &quot;halfsies&quot;: from the 
          beginning, some <i>thing</i> you <br>
          pronounced a beginning. Never an end in herself. The end comes. What 
          I must no longer love: <br>
          the way your eyelids move, fluttering to color themselves, the groove 
          I worked with my mouth <br>
          &amp; both hands. What I must remember to vanish from memory's palate: 
          your structure alias <br>
          agency (moiety/mass moiety). Emotion's forced migration. My graciousness, 
          gone with <br>
          the wind, seceding out the caving-in of my chest. Nothing prepared me 
          for angry sadness: <br>
          a stranger in a strangeland, misplaced, displaced out of your plans. 
          When did the fever begin? <br>
          I think about your touching me and it makes me sick. I think about your 
          touching and I want <br>
          it. Touch this--<i>cut</i>--it runs from ear to ear. Grinning, when 
          the scar appears it will bare<br>
          your resemblance. When I wake at night, my lack is breath: I cannot 
          breathe; you knocked<br>
          the wind out of my sail. Evicted, kicked me out of myself. Thanks for 
          launching a sinking ship.<br>
          Thanks for fine-timing your exit. <i>Bon voyage</i>. I'd pin a corsage 
          to each breast before you go.<br>

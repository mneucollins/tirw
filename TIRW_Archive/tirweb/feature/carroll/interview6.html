        <p><b>HB:</b> Can you say a bit more about how the poem-prints for <i>Secession</i> 
          were created? </p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> The poem-prints (of &quot;A Good Badgirl's Alphabet&quot; 
          and &quot;Patchwork Guilt&quot;) are linoleum cuts. With these as well 
          as the other poems in <i>Secession</i>, I went through multiple drafts 
          (probably a minimum of fifty for each poem in the collection). So, the 
          process of creating them goes something like this: I sketch out possibilities, 
          until I reach something with which I am satisfied (or, at least satisfied 
          enough that minor revisions will not totally wreck it). I, then, have 
          to transfer the poem to a linoleum block (this is fairly easy to do 
          by drawing to scale the poem, scotch-taping it to the block, and then 
          rubbing over the paper's entire surface with a pencil). What appears 
          is the mirror image of the poem that I, then, trace over with permanent 
          marker (so that I won't lose that image). </p>
        <p>From there, I begin the long process of carving the poem in reverse 
          (just as I've marked it). Depending on the size of the block (many of 
          these are 8&quot; x 10&quot; or 8&quot; x 12&quot;, others involve multiple 
          blocks) and the details of the print (and other obligations in my life), 
          this can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Things also 
          can get slowed down quite a bit if I make a mistake. Because there isn't 
          any way to fix it, I have to recarve the entire thing (which is especially 
          distressing if the error happens toward the end of the process, i.e., 
          I've actually carved &quot;Q&quot; twice because I realized after printing 
          the first block that I'd accidentally carved one of the letters in reverse 
          [this was before I'd acquired the habit of using permanent marker to 
          go over text I'd transferred and I soon realized carving without a clear 
          roadmap was something like attempting a tightrope act sans safety net]. 
          &quot;Q&quot; is a very complicated print so honestly when this happened 
          I felt like throwing the block through my living room's picture-window, 
          but, instead, I sat down and started over again&#133; as one so often 
          is forced to do when reality enters the room. Now, reflecting on that 
          mistake [a single backward &quot;g&quot;] I wonder what it would have 
          been like to have decided something else; i.e., to embrace the error. 
          In the interim, I started to fantasize about my collection in these 
          rather violent terms, specifically, 'I don't want my book to be published 
          and sit behind a window's glass, I want the book to be something that 
          is hurled through the window&quot;-- a predictably wannabe avant-garde 
          fantasy, one-foot-on, one-foot-off the ground&#133;). </p>
        <p>Anyhow, after carving the block, it is time to print. I use water-soluble 
          ink and a very simple transfer technique called spooning. I ink the 
          block and drop it on the paper. I press firmly all the way around to 
          make sure the print and the paper are well connected, then, I carefully 
          pull the paper off the countertop or table and turn the block AND print 
          over together. I take a large wooden spoon and another gadget (which 
          looks like two doorknobs stuck together) and my hands (thank goodness 
          for the prehensile thumb) and rub vigorously where the block and print 
          are in contact (to make sure the ink transfers completely). At this 
          juncture, I usually take a peek -- see where the ink hasn't transferred 
          yet and give it an extra rubbing at that location, or note if ink came 
          off in other places (a signal that I needn't work anymore -- that print's 
          destined for the garbage bin). </p>
        <p>This first drop is always in a color (I tried doing the reverse-dropping 
          in black first and didn't like the result). Then, if I approve of the 
          print, I let it dry (usually overnight) and do the whole process over 
          again, printing on top of the first drop with black. In this second 
          printing, however, my objective differs -- I do not want a smooth transfer 
          of ink, but rather for the black to come off only in patches so that 
          the color of the first drop is apparent. To get this effect, I am a 
          lot more lax rubbing the print with the spoon. I like the double-drop 
          because it gives the print a shadow. It is a lot of work, though, and 
          often I'll have a beautiful print and ruin it by misaligning the second 
          time, which is to say, what gets tricky is trying to replicate the first 
          print, dropping the re-inked block exactly on top of it so the words 
          and images will still be legible. </p>
        <p>The process has trained me to be very patient and to realize that for 
          every twenty prints I drop, there may only be one that I keep. Needless 
          to say, this is a <i>hands-on</i> sequence, which has taken me many 
          years to complete. But, it has kept me company, traveling everywhere 
          with me. In part, the medium was appealing because it is inexpensive 
          and portable -- I could carve in temporary waystations (in hotel rooms, 
          friends' homes, at restaurants&#133; I used to carve blocks on airplanes 
          [kind of like people engrossed in knitting], but now I can't take the 
          lino-cutter on board, it doesn't make it through security). The sequence 
          accompanied me when I did my research in Mexico City for my dissertation. 
          I began the alphabet in Ithaca, New York, on a snowy day when I was 
          stuck indoors, I carved the last block in Durham, North Carolina. In 
          between, I worked in Mexico City, Oaxaca, Guadalajara, and Corpus Christi, 
          at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts and at the Constance Saltonstall 
          Foundation (many thanks to the last two locales for their generous support). 
        </p>
        <p>I conceived of the sequence as an alternate primer, as a retooling 
          of the alphabet (the so-called building blocks of language). Also, every 
          single one of these prints was made for someone. Many mark occasions 
          as well as letters of the alphabet, meaning I wanted to give something 
          materially poetic to family and friends. The result -- each letter contains 
          imbedded references to the person or people who were its recipients 
          (&quot;purloined letters&quot; of sorts). For instance, &quot;K&quot; 
          was conceived for friends who were married on North Carolina's outerbanks. 
          There are references in the poem to their lives and also to one of my 
          sister's (who was another wedding guest and whose name, like the bride's, 
          begins with the letter &quot;K&quot;). In the face of this explanation, 
          one could label these &quot;private&quot; poems; yet, one could read 
          them as well as an attempt to interpellate the private into the public. 
          Additionally, after the experience of writing the prose-poems in &quot;Secession&quot; 
          and &quot;The Poem-of-the-Month Club,&quot; I was interested in creating 
          work that was &quot;more accessible&quot; and &quot;breathable,&quot; 
          but did not sacrifice density. Finally, generally speaking, this medium 
          was initially appealing to me as a kind of nostalgic form. I wanted 
          an alternative to the keyboard. </p>
        <p>A few years earlier, I had remembered the pleasures of carving lino 
          blocks (something I learned in grade school), but was focusing on the 
          creation of wordless images. When the idea crossed my mind of carving 
          a poem, something &quot;clicked&quot; inside. Furthermore, I always 
          had envisioned letters in reverse. When I learned to write as a child 
          (which I remember longing to be able to do), I composed everything as 
          its mirror-opposite and had to be reoriented, convinced that the river 
          flowed in the other direction, so to speak. Okay, this story thus far 
          sounds contrived/clich&eacute;d (and things are about to get a lot worse), 
          but, the subsequent sensation of (en)forced reversal literally and metaphorically 
          followed me, like a stray pup, into adulthood. The blocks made sense, 
          then, because they (re)presented an instance in which &quot;I could 
          have it both ways&quot; -- write as I liked, but still be legible to a 
          wider audience. </p>
        <p>As a postscript to all this, recently two members of Duke University's 
          Franklin Center, Jason Doty and Jessica Mitchell helped me to scan ALL 
          the prints into the computer, play with PhotoShop, and create a PDF 
          version of the collection (my hat is completely off to Jason and Jessica&#133; 
          their assistance and overwhelming belief in my work was absolutely invaluable 
          in literal and psychic terms). </p>
        <p><b>HB: </b>I know that a number of these poems and poem-prints have 
          been published separately. We look forward to the publication of <i>Secession</i> 
          and to seeing more of your work in the future.</p>

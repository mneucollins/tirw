        <p><b>HB:</b> &quot;To participate in certain rhythms outside of the prescriptive&quot; 
          -- I'm intrigued by your choice of words here. In some of your poems 
          there seems to be an almost Mother Goose-like rhythm, which I certainly 
          associate with certain prescriptive social codes. But in &quot;<a href="sanpatricio.html" target="_blank">San 
          Patricio</a>&quot; there's a clear jazz influence in the way the language 
          riffs off of regular rhythms and expressions to bend them into something 
          new yet still connected. Is this kind of rhythmic performativity what 
          you mean?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> Well, I will say that &quot;San Patricio&quot; harbors a 
          fairly obvious reference to James Baldwin's short story &quot;Sonny's 
          Blues.&quot; I have loved Baldwin's work from the moment I was introduced 
          to it, but that story has particular resonance for me -- both in terms 
          of the subject matter it treats and the way that Baldwin uses language 
          rhythmically to contemplate Sonny's relationship to music. I'll also 
          offer the obvious observation that &quot;San Patricio&quot; attempts 
          to create a Spanglish rhythm insofar as it shuttles between, puns in, 
          and merges Spanish and English. </p>
        <p>You are not the first to tell me that my work exhibits a &quot;Mother 
          Goose-like rhythm.&quot; In response, I'll repeat that I tried to be 
          quite deliberate in the formal choices I made while writing this collection 
          in the hopes that a symbiosis between <i>Secession's</i> form and content 
          would be apparent to the reader. Many of these poems return to certain 
          &quot;primal scenes&quot; of childhood (for instance, &quot;Watchfulness&quot; 
          or &quot;Tick-Tock&quot;) to underscore the temporal fluidity of memory. 
          A Mother Goose-like rhythm recalls the &quot;poetry of childhood,&quot; 
          while also lending itself to momentum, revision, and/or accumulation. 
          Literally, words begin to &quot;stick&quot; to each other when rhyme 
          and rhythm intersect. I tried to put some of that stickiness to work 
          for me. Of course, many poets have rewritten &quot;Mother Goose&quot; 
          or childhood narratives (Anne Sexton, for instance, who also uses these 
          narratives and forms to question the construct of femininity). This 
          said, when I wrote &quot;certain rhythms outside of the prescriptive,&quot; 
          I again meant in terms of BOTH form and content. Alternately parsed, 
          I am intensely interested in the rhythms of sound, but also the various 
          vibrations of the self (Circadian rhythms included, although that does 
          smack of a certain essentialism). </p>
        <p>But, I'd reiterate that I wanted to write a <i>collection</i> of poetry 
          that looked and sounded distinct (i.e., distinct from contemporary U.S. 
          poetry). I underscore &quot;collection&quot; because that was one of 
          the central very simple questions for me: what constitutes a collection 
          (which sounds to the ear as well like, &quot;What constitutes a collective?&quot;)? 
          And, concomitantly, what makes poems hold together, what kind of rhythms 
          can emerge over the course of a <i>body</i> of work? How does one establish 
          a recognizable grammar for &quot;ungrammatical bodies,&quot; not necessarily 
          normative, but drawing upon certain linguistic tenets? How does one 
          write a single poem, which obviously belongs stylistically to a larger 
          project? I thought, &quot;I want this collection to operate <i>dialectically</i>, 
          for one poem to represent, to perform the whole and vice-versa.&quot; 
          And, I realized this manner of thinking was a luxury I'd permitted myself 
          insofar as the expansive conceit of a &quot;collection&quot; gave me 
          ample time and space in which to take hitherto unimaginable liberties 
          with the interconnection between languages (on the most basic level, 
          my attempt to create an alternate primer) and worldviews. </p>

        <p><b>HB:</b> I'd like to ask you about the methods you use for creating 
          these works, especially given your interest in revision and the prescriptive. 
          Are any of the poems procedural? I'm thinking in particular of &quot;D,&quot; 
          which is written in concentric circles and in which most of the words 
          begin with the same letter. Obviously words which use the letter &quot;d&quot; 
          are given preference here, but did you use any other compositional rules 
          to create this poem?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> Not procedural, per se, although &quot;D&quot; has a wonderful 
          history. I grew up in South Texas (please send money there to bolster 
          resources for public education). My mother is an art teacher at Windsor 
          Park elementary public school in Corpus Christi. Once when I was visiting 
          she asked me to instruct a class -- to show the students my work and 
          teach them how to make a linoleum block print. I was embarking on &quot;D&quot; 
          at the time and I had a brainstorm. I wanted to create a present for 
          these students and for my mother (whose name is Donna). I solicited 
          from them their favorite &quot;D&quot; words at the end of every class 
          period (all the students were fifth-graders, but there were several 
          sections, because art is taught on a rotating basis, i.e., my mother 
          teaches ALL grade levels, and so fifth-graders come on Fridays, one 
          classroom after another). The students thought my desire for words was 
          really funny, just as they loved the title of the sequence &quot;A Good 
          Badgirl's Alphabet,&quot; and my streaming narrative of civil disobedience. 
          After I'd gathered all their little sweaty pieces of paper/contributions, 
          I began to write the poem. </p>
        <p>I imagined the letter &quot;D&quot; as a stone thrown into the middle 
          of my composition. I then sought to envision the ripple effects of ideas 
          and languages akin to some butterfly theory of chaosmosis and, voi l&agrave;, 
          &quot;D&quot; emerged as a series of concentric circles. Notably, I 
          included every word I was gifted in the hopes of generating an assemblage 
          (obviously students liberally borrowed from their neighbors to repeat 
          certain words -- isn't recycling marvelous? -- yet, in this context, 
          their borrowing didn't hold a candle to mine). I did provide connectors/approximation 
          of transitions, but some of what appears as such, i.e., &quot;<i>a word 
          i earned for when things go wrong</i>&quot; is actually an explanation 
          a student included with his suggestion (e.g., that notation was meant 
          to teach me the meaning of &quot;dinglehopper,&quot; and, predictably, 
          I had the socks charmed off my feet by that gesture of solidarity&#133; 
          I mean, who doesn't need &quot;a word for when things go wrong&quot;?). 
        </p>
        <p>So, the poem reads: D/Didgeridoo./Diamondback./Whole-in-one. Ditto. 
          Dingbat. Diminutives of de-/rivatives. Deuteronomy. Disbelief. Systems. 
          Theory. Disaster. Re-/lief. Devanagari. Endangered. Specie. (Dracula. 
          Dingo. Dada.) The devil's blued/her dungarees. Damnation: my devotion: 
          port of intrigue. Two marks dart the neck (dry, clean)./Dash-dash--dinglehopper--<i>a 
          word i earned for when things go wrong</i>. It's always darkest before 
          the dawn./A doughnut, dizzy as a dictionary (lo$$/found): one more dumpling 
          dimpling a town./(Domino affect) (deviation, divine): dinosaurs lumber, 
          damsels distress./The diaper is dirty. Well, den. Change it. <a href="interview5.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

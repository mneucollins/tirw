        <p><b>HB:</b> &quot;D&quot; is actually a graphic poem, and I know that 
          not only have selections from &quot;Secession&quot; appeared in a number 
          of journals and collections but several of the print-poems have appeared 
          as part of art exhibitions. Would you say a bit more about the relationship 
          between the verbal and the visual in your work? Do you consider the 
          print-poems to be equally visual art and poetry?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> The relationship between the word and the image is one of 
          the central (formal) questions I am grappling with in my work. One sees 
          this in <i>Secession</i> -- in both my experimentation with the endstopped 
          prose-poem in the sections &quot;Secession&quot; and &quot;The Poem-of-the-Month 
          Club&quot; and in my sequence of poem-prints &quot;A Good Badgirl's 
          Alphabet.&quot; </p>
        <p>I noticed something in your line of questioning: I always refer to 
          my final sequence as poem-prints, whereas you reversed the order of 
          the hyphenated terms, calling them print-poems. I was struck by this 
          immediately, but, in turn, decided it would have some bearing on my 
          response to your final question. While I consider these pieces to be 
          both visual art and poetry, I accent the poetry part. At the day's end, 
          I'm still convinced they are poems, which draw upon the visual in their 
          form. But, I guess that's up for interpretation: I was surprised when 
          I first began that sequence and people started referring to me as BOTH 
          a poet and a visual artist. I had interpreted my turn to the linocut 
          as simply a formal shift brought on by the question of language's materiality. 
          The prints for me were about <i>marking</i> words as material, where 
          each cut to create a letter, a word, a line, involved making a decision, 
          configuring language in terms of touch. Now, I can <i>see</i> that work 
          also as resolutely visual, but the funny thing was in the beginning 
          the question for me was not about the sense of &quot;sight,&quot; but 
          rather that of &quot;touch&quot; (which had everything to do with content-based 
          questions of connection that also haunted me, i.e., my concerns with 
          love, intimacy, sexuality&#133;.). </p>
        <p>In tandem with the above observation, I'd hazard I've learned a lot 
          from writing <i>Secession</i>. My more recent work is even more recognizably 
          &quot;visual/material.&quot; I am engaged in two projects: one with 
          digital images-poems, and the second, the Public Poetry Project (<a href="http://www.publicpoetryproject.org" target="_blank">www.publicpoetryproject.org</a>) 
          (mil gracias to Pat McGonigle for listening to my &quot;I have a dream&#133;&quot; 
          speech and making this website a reality) that seeks to locate words/poetry 
          in public spaces (as its title suggests) and to configure writing as 
          a potential act of collaboration. So, again, I would call this work 
          visual, but ultimately underscore its attentions to the materiality 
          of the poetic. </p>
        <p>Time and again, I am trying to find forms for the contents I wish to 
          express and the prevailing models in contemporary (U.S.) poetry available 
          often feel limiting to me. On the flipside, dissatisfaction lends itself 
          to a wandering eye: the poem-prints would not have been possible without 
          my knowledge of the rich tradition of linocuts in both Mexican graphic 
          art and the Chicano/a movement(s) in the United States. The Public Poetry 
          Project would not have been imaginable for me without the varied traditions 
          of public art, including muralism and earthworks. And, I am convinced 
          the digital images I am creating would not have crossed my mind without 
          my having been exposed to an inter-American corpus of performance and 
          body art. I am not writing in a vacuum, my work seeks to participate 
          in larger conversations concerning interdisciplinarity, mixed media, 
          and the constitution of the Americas. </p>
        <p>Finally, along these lines, I would refer you to a recent collaboration 
          I participated in: part-poetry, part-visual art, part-theatre, part-translation. 
          In 2002-2003, I worked as the translator and co-designer of subtitles 
          for Claudio Vald&eacute;s Kuri's U.S. theatrical production of <i>El 
          autom&oacute;vil gris/The Grey Automobile</i> (currently on tour). The 
          play is fascinating because its protagonist is the 1919 Mexican silent 
          film of the same name. In the Spanish versions of the production, Vald&eacute;s 
          Kuri relies upon Japanese-style Benshi narrators and a piano player 
          to interpret the film (and give it a contemporary twist). He asked me 
          to translate and create English subtitles for the film/play (of the 
          Benshis' dialogue). In effect, I became the fourth Benshi, if you count 
          the piano player as the third (which I do). The piece is incredibly 
          &quot;postmodern&quot; -- for lack of a better word -- dependent upon 
          parody and pastiche, layered, oscillating between two turn-of-the-century 
          Mexico Cities. I was given and took many liberties. Vald&eacute;s Kuri 
          encouraged me to experiment with both the forms and contents of the 
          subtitles, and for the final scene he asked me to write a visual poem 
          that a digital graphic artist Dmitry Kmelnitsky (also collaborating 
          on the project) animated. This was a singular experience for me-seeing 
          my poetry on the big screen -- and, in the best possible sense, I have 
          not &quot;recovered&quot; from the sensation of viewing it through such 
          a prism. For more on <i>El autom&oacute;vil gris/The Grey Automobile</i>,

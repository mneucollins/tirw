        <p><b>HB:</b> Some of the works in this collection seem like performance 
          poems. &quot;<a href="breathe.html" target="_blank">Breathe</a>,&quot; 
          for example, would probably do well in a Nuyorican Caf&eacute;-style 
          slam, while others suggest a jazz influence. Have any of these works 
          been performed?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> It doesn't surprise me that you write this. I study Mexican 
          and U.S. performance (mainly work based in the visual arts) and alternative 
          art in the parallel universe of my academic research and prose. Tangentially, 
          I would claim the 80s/90s U.S. tradition of performance poetry as an 
          influence. And, although I cannot even read music (it's embarrassing 
          to admit to one's illiteracies in an interview), I would say that these 
          poems owe a great debt to various musical traditions, including jazz. 
          I have given several readings -- not translatable into &quot;performances&quot; 
          but I think I feel comfortable claiming I have a distinctly &quot;performative&quot; 
          style of presentation. Moreover, I wrote these poems by reading (sometimes 
          half-singing) them aloud; meaning, I depend upon <i>hearing</i> (as 
          well as <i>seeing</i>) the momentum of the image and the word. </p>
        <p><b>HB:</b> Would you discuss the role of sexual imagery in your work? 
          You use a number of explicit sexual references both in your language 
          and in the visual images of the print-poems, yet I wouldn't say the 
          collection is &quot;about&quot; sex. </p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> No, I wouldn't say the collection is &quot;about&quot; sex. 
          In fact, I might be more inclined to claim the collection to be about 
          negotiating relationships between words like &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; 
          &quot;desire,&quot; &quot;intimacy,&quot; &quot;intersubjectivity,&quot; 
          between categories like &quot;the political&quot; and &quot;the aesthetic.&quot; 
          But, any narrative of intentionality, as we're taught to believe, is 
          fraught, fragile, easily perishable (or, at the very least, sports a 
          remarkably short shelf-life) (so, perhaps what I claim above only demonstrates 
          that I have a habit of generously scarequoting). Take #2: sexual imagery 
          in <i>Secession</i> facilitated my speaking about certain forms of subjectivity, 
          which I didn't think were receiving enough and/or any attention on the 
          greater radar screen(s) of pop &amp; high cultures (I know, I know, 
          I'm making a dubious distinction&#133;). </p>
        <p><b>HB:</b> I assume the lesbian subject position is one of those &quot;certain 
          forms&quot; you're referring to. It's interesting that although the 
          &quot;I&quot; of the poems seems to resist most identity categories, 
          the lesbian subject position seems to remain unchallenged. Why is that?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> I think I would say the identity category this collection 
          claims is the &quot;queer subject position&quot; (understood as the 
          mixed, the hybrid) as an impossibly impure vantagepoint (versus the 
          lesbian). It seemed to me absolutely essential strategically (pun intended) 
          to bring sexuality to the table in <i>Secession</i>. I was angry and 
          put out by events in this country like the Senate confirmation hearings 
          of Clarence Thomas (the disavowal of Anita Hill's testimony!) and the 
          Senate hearings on gays in the military. I was (and continue to be) 
          irrevocably shaken by U.S. inattention to AIDS, by the country's refusal 
          to grant full citizenship to (sexual) minority populations, by the ever-increasing 
          gap between the haves and have-nots. This collection offers up some 
          of my reflections on the political climate in which I lived when I wrote 
          it (between 1994 and 2001). If the &quot;lesbian subject position seems 
          to remain unchallenged&quot; in <i>Secession</i> it was because in every 
          other space it was attacked daily and I saw my writing as a kind of 
          sanctuary against besiegement. </p>
        <p>But, lest I continue to sound defensive (or perhaps to maintain that 
          very defensive offensive), let's fastforward to some of the present's 
          own states of emergency: I'm struck now by the limitations of what Anna 
          Deavere Smith has called &quot;generating safehouses,&quot; even as 
          I harbor the sensation that it's absolutely necessary to keep the gas 
          pilot of the utopic lit. So, in my recent poetic endeavors, I find myself 
          &quot;challenging&quot; this &quot;queer subject position&quot; as well 
          (insider advantage). To get to this point, however, I needed to establish 
          a homebase (in the guise of <i>Secession</i>), to give myself a fighting 
          chance to imagine the fluidity of an unfolding present, where the risk 
          of loving someone or something would be a democratic proposition, as 
          perishable as any myth of sovereignty/narrative of intentionality. Finally, 
          I began <i>Secession</i> with the premise that I intended to write a 
          <i>feminist</i> and <i>queer </i>collection that would explore some 
          of the contemporary default lines of identity -- notably, race, gender, 
          and sexuality. <a href="interview3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        <p><b>HB:</b> I think the form of your writing points to this struggle 
          between a desire to interrogate all subject positions and the need for 
          safehouses, especially, as you suggest, for groups under siege. The 
          poems in <i>Secession</i> seem to move back and forth between expressivism, 
          by which I mean the natural expression of a unique and coherent &quot;I,&quot; 
          and constructivism, or writing that participates in the construction 
          of a method of thought and the <i>formation</i> of a subject position. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm thinking particularly of the opening lines to &quot;We&quot;: &quot;This 
          eye seeks to gleam how we inure the falls we heed to insure two-stepping, 
          part privilege, parcel remedy, seasoning tossed in a morass to stew, 
          haphazard, the loss of an <i>I</i> and a <i>you</i>. Once the thought 
          of relinquishing the leased quotient of autonomy / banished me to a 
          no man's land, unwilling to forfeit a single expense. But to gain, we 
          must give, something gone, we lose to win temporary consensus, veering 
          short / of essence, originary penchants.&quot; The doubleness of the 
          language in the first sentence (&quot;eye&quot;/I, &quot;inure&quot;/&quot;insure,&quot; 
          even the implied reference to the absent idiom &quot;part and parcel&quot;) 
          repeatedly offers sets of meaning in which the two related elements 
          are not identical and yet not quite separate either. The result is the 
          joining of the &quot;I&quot; and the reader into a &quot;we&quot; that 
          must always be reconstituted in the act of reading, thereby rejecting 
          a fixed communal identity. And yet by the third line &quot;we&quot; 
          has taken on a moralizing tone that speaks for the reader rather than 
          with her. </p>
        <p><b>AC: </b>I would agree that the poems move between expressivism and 
          constructivism insofar as I believe in the constructed nature of expressivism 
          itself. Look, I was trying to imagine for myself an &quot;I&quot; I 
          could grow into, meaning I was attempting a kind of coup, the construction 
          of a non-negotiable subjectivity, which was unflinching in the face 
          of overwhelming odds against it (think about the slim chances of any 
          endangered species making it to adulthood). Which is to say, I felt 
          compelled to create a (secret) self, someone aesthetically and politically 
          uncompromising, because the alternative seemed to me to be either an 
          absolute denial of some basic inequalities in this country and world, 
          or narratives of victimhood, which missed the boat of what Toni Morrison 
          so aptly labels, &quot;Something rogue. Something else you have to figure 
          in before you can figure it out.&quot; Meaning (among other things), 
          as a kind of postscript, when I write &quot;non-negotiable,&quot; a 
          key element in this subjectivity was (and is) a sense of humor -- I knew 
          any &quot;I&quot; worth her salt wouldn't make it past day-one without 
          the ability to laugh at her own constructed expressivism&#133; hence, 
          the melodramatic, campy, rasquache, kitsch, cursi, disidentifying gauntlet 
          of emotion one firewalks in these poems. Hmmm&#133;. I don't know about 
          &quot;the moralizing tone&quot; you reference, I suspect it's more of 
          a problem in my answers to your questions (sigh). </p>
        <p><b>HB:</b> Or maybe it points to the importance of my role as reader, 
          which seems to be a contested issue throughout the collection. There's 
          a particular moment in &quot;Secession (ii),&quot; for example, when 
          the poem sounds almost like a magic spell, as though the poem were trying 
          to work its powers on the reader. And, as if to drive this home, the 
          next poem in the collection is entitled &quot;You,&quot; interpellating 
          the reader directly. Yet my experience of reading the density of the 
          language was not that I was lulled by it but rather that it made me 
          a much more active reader. Are you trying to encourage readers, or even 
          language-users in general, to take a more active role somehow?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> I suppose I did want an active reader. Actually, I wanted 
          the reader to virtually experience the sensation of claustrophobia, 
          to be backed into the density of the poems in <i>Secession</i>, to feel 
          as if there was not enough room to breathe or speak because (1) I wanted 
          to formally and content-wise replicate a kind of identitarian claustrophobia 
          I was feeling at the time, and (2) generally speaking, I am drawn to 
          excess, the (neo)baroque, montage, recycling, and a denser poem lends 
          itself to these (albeit clich&eacute;d [post]modern) accumulative representational 
          tactics. </p>
        <p>The sequence &quot;Secession&quot; for me was about something else 
          as well, though: I was grappling with pronouns, trying to come to terms 
          with an &quot;I&quot; and &quot;You&quot; and their possible relationships/connections 
          (&quot;We&quot;). Which is to say, the &quot;secessions&quot; I was 
          attempting to spark, jumpstart were content-based as well as formal, 
          i.e., I was trying to make a convincing argument (to, the very least, 
          myself) that it was possible to break away from sociocultural ectoplasm 
          and greater prefabricated game-plans, to participate in certain rhythms 
          outside of the prescriptive. I suppose I would be more cautious now 
          in the range of my ambition, still, I have an immense affection for 
          the &quot;I's&quot; (and the motley assortment of pronouns) of these 
          poems. <a href="interview4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

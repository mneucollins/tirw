        <p><i>Secession</i>, Amy Sara Carroll's collection of poems, is divided 
          into three parts: &quot;Secession,&quot; which splices together a variety 
          of poetic forms,languages, and images; &quot;The Poem-of-the-Month Club,&quot; 
          which experiments with the prose-poem; and &quot;A Good Badgirl's Alphabet,&quot; 
          which is modelled after a child's reading primer.</p>
        <p><b>HB:</b> The title of your collection &quot;Secession&quot; says 
          a lot. The word itself signifies a withdrawal from an association, organization, 
          or alliance, and the poems certainly seem to resist not only personal 
          identity classifications based on characteristics such as race and gender 
          but also poetic classifications based on such categories as genre or 
          affiliation with a movement. From what would you say these poems are 
          seceding? Are they making an attempt to get outside of categories, especially 
          oppositional ones, altogether?</p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> I meant the title of this collection to operate on multiple 
          planes. I wanted a reader to hear the resonances of political secession 
          (although not in U.S. terms, which would script some opposition between 
          a North and South, unless perhaps, one wanted to think of reclaiming 
          that geographic configuration to mean &quot;a global North versus a 
          global South&quot;). I also wanted the reader to recall the Viennese 
          Secession movement and that of Photo-Secession, to remember the ways 
          that &quot;secession&quot; as a term has been used in artistic venues. 
          I suppose I would say I created these poems to secede from certain limited 
          worldviews I myself had acquired (from the left, from the right, and 
          from the meddling, middling [neo]liberal), that I wanted to write myself 
          into another space of politicized affect. </p>
        <p>Of course, my explanation betrays a hopelessly utopic sentiment, one, 
          which ultimately I found myself questioning/dismantling within the collection 
          (bless that deconstructive impulse!). Put differently by the time I 
          had a draft of <i>Secession</i> in hand, I felt I'd <br>
          beached myself on a desert island that smelled faintly of the Enlightenment 
          and/or the bevy of modernisms.... Which only proves: we carry lots of 
          baggage on-board, even when our so-called intentions are to travel light(ly). 
          And, yes, in response to your ultimate question, in this collection 
          I desperately was attempting to live outside of categories, especially 
          oppositional ones, to the extent that in the writing of these poems, 
          I had many imaginary interlocutors, including myself.</p>
        <p><b>HB:</b> So would you say that part of what you discovered is that 
          it is not possible to live outside the categories altogether? </p>
        <p><b>AC:</b> Yes. Or, perhaps I'd say that I &quot;(re)discovered&quot; 
          that it wasn't even desirable to attempt to do so, that absolute affirmation 
          or dismissal of an idea or category at times is more problematic than 
          the category itself, that a process of disidentification (in the way 
          that Jos&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz floats the term) depends upon recycling 
          certain elements of that which seems impossible, that an osmotic relationship 
          exists between the so-called outside and inside worlds. <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

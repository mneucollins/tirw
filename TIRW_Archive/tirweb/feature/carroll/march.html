<p>The dust rises, that springtime precipitation we greet at street corners 
          as it warms/<br>
          warns us gently to cover our mouths as we cough anxiously. Some sputum, 
          bottoms up,<br>
          bottomed out. The dust bides its time, too happy to advise us to cap 
          our affections,<br>
          to cautiously yield emotion up on some silver platter, steeled. It's 
          different from snow's<br>
          dusty finger-wagging. It's different from salt scattering, reckoned 
          to keep sidewalks<br>
          less slippery before and after they consent to sweat away the malefactors 
          that commence <br>
          to collect in the veins like an oh-so-grave pronouncement euphemismed, 
          <i>I'm sorry to say... </i><br>
          better known in some parts as arterial regret. No regrets here. I like 
          what I get. Still,<br>
          I reckoned on some little extra kick when the rooftops slant, anxious 
          to let it all go,<br>
          let it hang out, the laundry for show, let the weight slide--whatever 
          goes, whatever <br>
          they shoulder, maybe the road. Some saint turned soft at the cross, 
          middle, some hope all<br>
          aslush at the base of the slope, that slalom of the neck, that resolute 
          route some paperboy<br>
          takes to paper himself--new shoes, new suit (Shoot!), sweet serenade, 
          suite as the boot<br>
          that sends someone to the grave. New attitude, shed for the season, 
          shedding light upon <br>
          the self-taking-self hostage situation, an aloof watershed, little nick 
          where anything might <br>
          collect. Taxes or rations. How taxing, an affect: to ration out every 
          action, exact, a qualified <br>
          and certified, bonafide fact(!), cutting off guttering at the kneecaps, 
          quotienting out groping<br>
          to the highest sousciant. The fruit of our labors: alienation. Gross 
          annual product of anticipation. <br>
          Growth <i>sputter spurt</i>: pain, the oldest gain, drip-drop, tick-tock, 
          the snow, spurned, sane,<br>
          I-want-this-to-work<i> I want to remain gainfully employed</i>. The 
          strain, I'll take what you've <br>
          got, odd jobs, whatnot, to treat myself to something to eat, out, a 
          ready-when-you-are <i>ready</i>, <br>
          <i>set, go</i>... alterity, will to know. I suppose you suppose you 
          see something, that I haven't begun <br>
          to show verily, a little letter, the order of the day, kept inside, 
          tucked way, all that jazz that <br>
          refuses to play. Yeah, that extra-wide chasm under wraps to crack the 
          side, walks the silence;<br>
          heaviness guaranteed to break a back, nip luck in the buck, bring on 
          the bash, shoot the shit,<br>
          the breeze at long last. Step lightly, my love, you fit like a glove, 
          sputum and sputter, what suits <br>
          the sun is good for the goose, good for the gander, that dust presupposing 
          meltdown's disaster. <br>
          Now I can't recall when I didn't want you to give me that grand tour 
          wherewithal, tip of<br>
          the hat, some ponyride to the other side. All well and good, I've come 
          alive, wading; and, like <br>
          any continent, cagey to bind its seceding, I'm feeling full of uneasy 
          peckings about some easy, <br>
          over, on the light side, in-cohoots-with-the-light (-in-August), light 
          saber allied, what it means <br>
          to go easy. What makes me tick is time gone easy as the days grow up, 
          the dust and the luck <br>
          it brings for the leaving, the taking, the breathing, that suck-at-your-teeth 
          intake reeling, <i>Time is <br>
          x, time is why I'll take myself to the other side. And you, with your 
          own scavenging eye, may <br>
          or may not follow my why-vexed annexed roving-rock I. Ready or not, 
          I'm liable to cry, </i><br>
          <i>a girl's gotta go, a girl's gotta try.</i> Loose cannonball feeling, 
          loose canon, some ceiling. <br>
          The condition I fish in is on the dark side, thin ebb of evil most of 
          the time. Used to be<br>
          a rupture, apologetic faultline, now it's becoming the norm for the 
          time. Being. Could be there <br>
          may come some day, bright comment in the sky when I wake with answers 
          to questions scare-<br>
          squared away, neatly columned, which is to say: a higher order, everything 
          A-O.K.. But<br>
          for now, the niche, the logic I twist is closer to some stardusty coin 
          flip. For the time, for<br>
          the record, the wrecker, it's 1-2-3, pull up the anchor, make way to 
          secede. I see the dust rising: <br>
          dust on my teeth, dust on the lens, sand in the picnic, glitter in the 
          ends. I've taken to dusting as <br>
          if that could bend an ear to the springtime, could lend itself to spring 
          sprucing, that timed<br>
          (sands of time) springboard goosing, skip-hop-step, known in some circles 
          as taking on regret, <br>
          the lead, leavetaking, taking leave, leaving. I've taken to dusting 
          like some folks (<i>choke</i>) take<br>
          to things: fine china or linen, collecting antiques. I've taken to dusting, 
          it's easier to own <br>
          what's already at hand, what I've already known, then to let new territory 
          wrestle the throne <br>
          away from its heir before she can loam the kingdom in all its tyranny 
          (less is more--that dusty <br>
          hyperbole, hypoallegorical philosophy), I've taken to dusting, it's 
          a way of keeping score. <br>
          Always already, the dust I abhor, as the days hasten to make ends meet, 
          make themselves<br>
          into news to believe, longer toward the solstice, what's surely in store 
          for the wise if<br>
          they guess what they're scavenging for. A use-value occasion for tallying 
          the score:<br>
          we're on scavenger hunts with our own private parts as clues. We're 
          our own private<br>
          detectives who'd better make use of any and every canonball loose. So, 
          I've taken to<br>
          dusting, allergizing, lusting to abuse my welcome on this sphere mightily, 
          to amuse myself<br>
          when the sitcoms seem particularly lacking in what I need. I've taken 
          to dusting as a way<br>
          to ease mine, affliction, to lessen the more than doubletime likely 
          I'm-leaving-scenario<br>
          when I don't glitter glibly as gold, when the dusk and the dust are 
          settling my score, when<br>
          I'm certain I'm less, rather than more. <i>All that glitters is not 
          gold and love's in the eye of<br>
          the beholder,</i> I'm told. Some eye of a needle in need of threading, 
          the sky as it threatens<br>
          the days as they're shedding that extra, put on for winter betting the 
          days would be colder,<br>
          shedding hesitation to take on new height. In my i you're the glitter 
          and gold worth<br>
          betting upon. One (<i>read!</i>) red-hot cinnamon, steaming hot dish, 
          a little-something-I-<br>
          whipped-up in the kitchen, some delicious commodity shunning its congealing, 
          concealing<br>
          fetishized form, sand dollar scholar (I'm keeping warm), tasty and nutritious, 
          hardy heart-<br>
          land, unassuming, ambitious. In comparison, I surface, less. I've come 
          up short, some bad,<br>
          hot check, bad penny, bad radio station fading in and out, a hangnail 
          nickel when a dime's<br>
          the shortorder of the day, hindsight's redemption, what the palmsters 
          say will keep for<br>
          a week if you don't overheat it on the first serving day. I've taken 
          to dusting my troubles<br>
          away. Rather than put grievous thoughts away, I've taken to dusting 
          the egregious away.<br>
          Boiled down to an essence, some precipitate precipice, I'd grin and 
          bear witness without<br>
          reservation, evasion, or vain self-mystification: I cannot abstain from 
          wanting your emotion, <br>
          from staking my claim on your devotion, a starry-eyed same sex offense 
          in all the best sense. <br>
          Off the fence, on the record, I do take offence at anything less because 
          anything more could <br>
          only represent less than what I've stored up for you, squirreled away, 
          for some low point, rainy, <br>
          regressive snow day, the blues, bluesy and floozy, I'm glad to see your 
          better half hunkered <br>
          down with me, better off used, best before the date printed on the package. 
          I'll take leave of<br>
          my senses to err on emphasis: <i>Girl, I keep a lot in store by you</i>. 
          I'm a little scared, but I wonder <br>
          who wouldn't be scared by a springclean, that notion that only time 
          can glean what winter <br>
          wouldn't let us leave before we were ready, before we were weaned of 
          the notion that we will <br>
          not be, only dust or glitter some day shortly. We do what we have to 
          when we're good and <br>
          ready. We do what we're apt to, anything less proves more frightening. 
          We do what we have <br>
          to, anything more's lessening, demeaning of meaning, demeaning of sense. 
          We do what we <br>
          have to distribute recompense. (This has everything and nothing to do 
          with a self.) We do <br>
          what we're apt to to know ourselves. <b>Centripetal force:</b> we do 
          what we have to <br>
          to decenter ourselves. <b>Centrifugal force:</b> we do what we have 
          to to center ourselves, to <br>
          secede, to toast cessation, sensation's cession roundly. I hold these 
          truths to be self-evident: <br>
          all persons are created equal, endowed with creative energies to dispense, 
          reason enough<br>
          for anyone to expect dispersal without further ado, pretense. I've spun 
          full circle, I do take<br>
          offense at those who do not live with the intent to centralize to the 
          extent that a center<br>
          is never the self's precedent, that a center is always a still, wider 
          net, a motion-field<br>
          electrified, spent, passion/reason to distribute wealth, a potlatch 
          to lessen the hoarding<br>
          of the self, to commit to the notion that one's more than a self, to 
          spin the bottle, to drink<br>
          to many healths. It's different from the snow, too well-known for dusting 
          all things<br>
          with a reluctance to own up to its resistance to abdicate the throne; 
          winter, some overly<br>
          protective home-hegemonic ruse, <i>Put on your boots, mittens, cap</i>. 
          It's different from<br>
          the salt, passive-aggressive to act. It's a dog-eat-dog world (<i>groan</i>). 
          I'm betting on you<br>
          to help me condone, fill and unfill (<i>It's reigning cats and dogs@%*!</i>) 
          my pot of gold,<br>
          to share-cherish, embarrass me with what you know, to dust me with trust, 
          to trust<br>
          that I'll know when to dust, when to glitter, when to go to some rainbow's 
          end to<br>
          settle for gold, to return in turn to you what I know, to settle for 
          nothing less than<br>
          a whole-part (<i>Arf!!!</i>) conviction you're my own, heartfelt/mindfelt, 
          dusted will, full,<br>
          relational explication, spinefelt, centric pull, spend-drift, eccentric 
          Freedman's Bureau. <br>

          Scripting the post: should I stay or should I go? (<i>No moss gathers 
          on a rolling<br>
          pin committed to rolling with the punches.</i>) Color me giddy. Cull 
          mi gold. Call<br>

          The soul, <br>

          <i>their</i> lines.<br>

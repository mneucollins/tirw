<p><b><font size="1">Our Day with Jerry Springer, page 3</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>Our return to the northern suburbs was much quieter than our morning descent; we joked briefly about the Springer spectacle, and then became quiet, each of us lost in the realization, perhaps, that what distinguished reality from performance was not so much our ability to critically analyze, but our distance from the event under inspection.  A colleague later asked me what possible relevance the field trip could have to an English class.  I went through my standard explanation of how cultural studies issues relate to what we think of as &quot;texts,&quot; highlighting the media's effect on cultural perception&#151;but I couldn't forget that I was defending an event at which I had shouted slurs at pregnant women. </p>
<p>Sure, Springer was a setup, part of a cynical regime of flippant popular culture, but within ten minutes of arrival at the set, we could no longer remain &quot;above it all.&quot;  The &quot;simulation&quot; of Springer became &quot;real&quot; for us &#151; and we were thrown into confusion about not only this, but everything.  Would we go back to our cozy classroom and continue hypothesizing that the world was full of specters and simulations? </p>
<p>No one in the group expected such a radical jolt out of our comfort zones.  We spoke about the experience like addicts in a twelve-step program; we wrote about the program on our online bulletinboard.  The &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot; had killed the class's ability to jump eyes-first into a &quot;text,&quot; but we were only pantomiming an autopsy.  Instead of questioning the validity of postmodernism from a postmodern position, the class seemed to question the ability of postmodernism to keep them safe from what they thought could be their &quot;essential&quot; selves &#151; screaming and clapping audience members.  Our ultimate response began with one student's idea to produce a &quot;Po-Mo Talk Show&quot; as the final class project arguing that, our experience, both enlightening and shameful, begged for a sort of public, Robert Downey Jr.-style detoxification.  We would re-create the conditions of our madness in hopes of finding a cure. </p>
<p>The students orchestrated two skits: a patient of Sigmund Freud would &quot;cheat&quot; on him with radical thinkers Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari; Burroughs's &quot;wild boys&quot; would disrupt an Oprah-like book-of-the-month club. We fretted for weeks until the night of our performance, staging and re-staging our own talk show experience.  The class, once masters of ironic distance, slowly deconstructed the conditions of the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot; that has elicited their frenzied participation.  Finally, our audience of college students watched in rapt attention as we deliberately burped and gurgled our way through an hour of parody, videotape, and group chants &#151; lip-synching not a single word.</p>
<p>***<br>
</p>
<p>In the meantime, our episode of Springer ran.  To my great surprise, the entire program was not focused on the obedient performance of our group, and not once could we be seen chanting &quot;pregnant whore.&quot;  The focal point of our entire semester experience became something else in the projection, and while we still puzzled over our own complicity in allowing the spectacle to proceed, we understood how easy our academic shields could turn us into a phalanx of riot police.  Separation from the critical moment allowed us a perspective from which to become &quot;ourselves&quot; again &#151; as well a vantage point from which to see &quot;ourselves&quot; as illusory.  Our proximity to the event gave it life, but our distance from its projection forced it back into that m&eacute;lange of white noise that my students seemed to perceive, even before taking my class, on a genetic level.  The post-Springer difference, however, is that we could no longer re-combine with such abandon.  We journeyed into the television screen as the audience, but we came out as the actors-which made us realize, that perhaps, in all of our confident analyses, we had been acting all along. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

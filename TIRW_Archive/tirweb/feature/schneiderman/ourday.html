Upon arriving at my first tenure-track position, assistant professor of English at a Midwest liberal arts college that would allow me to teach both creative writing and literature, with equal emphasis to each, I immediately began to survey the landscape of my 300-level postmodernism class.  Adding a &quot;graphic content&quot; warning to my syllabus, I asked this new class to jump eyes-first into Jean Genet's <i>Funeral Rites</i>, an X-rated romp through wartime Paris with characters engaged in sex fantasies with Hitler, before moving into William S. Burroughs's <i>The Wild Boys</i>, an equally unsettling study of reality films, revolutionary communes, and runaway bodily processes.  Bolstered by the works of postmodern theorists ranging from precursor Frederick Nietzsche to post-everything Jean Baudrillard, some students were confused, some appalled, and some energized.  Yet all of our discussions&#151;despite my best efforts during our weekly session in a respectable third-floor seminar room-remained completely and utterly &quot;academic.&quot;</p>
<p>Schooled in that 1990s' belief in the viability of cultural studies, I hoped a completely voluntary outing to the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot;-a program renowned for its universal trashiness&#151;would cause the three-orders of simulacra and the cultural logic of late capitalism to lean, in some small way, against the heavy side of that &quot;reality&quot; fulcrum.  I didn't go so far as to show movies such as <i>The Matrix</i> to teach the &quot;world&quot; as a relative cultural construction.  That seemed like the easy way out, and surprisingly, the students were largely convinced <i>a priori</i> of the postmodern condition; they were so excited by it all that we routinely pushed past our designated ending time, lost in rapt academic discussion.  It was too easy.  I began to suspect that within the recesses of their outward enthusiasm lurked the same sarcastic detachment from postmodernism as postmodernism projected onto everything else.</p>
<p>Then came September 11th.  <br>
</p>
<p>Discussing a post-attack cover of <i>The Village Voice</i>&#151;a postcard of the Twin Towers superimposed perfectly on the Manhattan skyline&#151;several students told me the only reality of the attacks for them was that their cell phone calls were temporarily blocked.  No one denied that the buildings had collapsed or that people had died; it all just seemed, somehow &quot;fake.&quot;  After all, this was Generation X mixed with Generation Y spiked with acute awareness of things like Prozac and post-irony.  They knowingly swam in endlessly crashing waves of simulation.  &quot;God is dead&quot; was really old news that Nine Inch Nails used to sing about, and I was just some nihilistic charlatan, my snake oil fermenting on the shelf because it couldn't compete with the high-sugar varieties of pop culture.</p>
<p>I hoped that the field trip would underscore this very postmodern problem of viewing postmodernism as so entirely &quot;constructed&quot; that its critiques proved useless.  Sure, it is easy enough for academics to either condemn or condone all cultural studies &quot;texts&quot; (including TV programs <i>and</i> wars) as part of the great sucking sound of American culture, but because we couldn't go to somewhere such as &quot;ground zero&quot; in New York City to convince ourselves of what about the terrorist attack was real, we went to the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot; to find out what about our &quot;reality&quot; was not. <a href="springer2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<p><b><font size="1">Our Day with Jerry Springer, page 2</font></b></p>

<p>Our bus dropped us in front of the NBC Tower in Chicago, local home to the network, the &quot;Jerry Springer Show,&quot; and its kissing cousin, the &quot;Jenny Jones&quot; show.  We were soon pressed into a large audience warm-up room filled with folding chairs, vending machines, and a few TVs.  We listened as the talking head announced a bus hijacking in Tennessee that everyone assumed was another terrorist attack.  The susurrus of joking, excited voices quieted to a low whisper, as the absurdity of our situation &#151; waiting for a trash culture oracle to wave shiny objects in front of us-became overly apparent.  Before long, though, the endless chatter restarted and we were led into the studio&#133;</p>
<p>Given a choice of seating either on or off camera, I chose the former.  A giant industrial fan controlled the rear of the stage; rimmed around the tops of the walls, green paint mimicked moldy tarnish on windows that peered into nowhere.  I suddenly felt very small, not like a &quot;hip&quot; new professor at all, but more like a victim, trapped in a basement with other bad children not so much younger than myself, waiting for something to happen.  And so began the videotape: This edition of Springer's &quot;Too Hot for TV&quot; endlessly detailed glittery undergarments dropping to the floor, flailing arms and legs smacking the faces of relatives and lovers, holiday turkeys and cranberry sauce flying violently across the set.  No matter the image, the shrill voices of Springer's past guests screamed over the cacophony of every repetitive moment, drowning out our increasingly uncomfortable laughter.  </p>
<p>Soon the producer, Todd, laden with headphones and electronic equipment, expounded on the importance of chanting &quot;Jerry!  Jerry!,&quot; as well as &quot;reacting&quot; to absolutely everything that would soon happen onstage.  It would be our responsibility to scream, to yell, and to follow his lead.  If I tell you to jump, Todd seemed to say, you not only ask &quot;how high?&quot; but also continue to bounce up and down until we cut to commercial.  Todd enforced the rules of his regime with exaggerated glances and hand gestures, so we practiced our clapping and chanting as Jerry Springer emerged for his warm-up of stale jokes (&quot;I don't like cocaine; I just like the way it smells&quot;).  After he suggested that his program could provide a respite from the &quot;war on terror,&quot; it seemed clear that Springer saw himself as a counterpoint to the concurrent events in Kabul and Kandahar.  He offered his show as valid cultural contributor not because of what it does, but because of what it deliberately does not.  </p>
<p>Todd encouraged us to chant &quot;pregnant whore&quot; &#151;repeatedly&#151; every time one of the show's four expectant mothers unloaded her particular secret. One young woman in my group appeared to chant with supercharged glee, screaming noticeably louder than Todd's hand signals demanded.  Even the reticent members of my group thrust their arms into the air.  On the stage, an African American woman told her boyfriend that her unborn baby's father was really a white transvestite.  As the transvestite almost came to blows with an audience heckler, I wondered if our guerrilla analysis mission had turned the students into post-millennium Patty Hearsts.  That is, until I realized that my hands were also thrown high into the air, that I was screaming and laughing, that I was fixated on the floating overhead camera that always seemed to turn its eye on me.  As my voice immediately became hoarse with shame (hadn't I spent years in academia combating this sort of thing?), Todd gave me a sly smile, followed by a slight upward wave of his hand. </p>
<p>I decided that my only response could be to silently lip-synch the chants of &quot;Jerry! Jerry!&quot; and &quot;pregnant whore,&quot; but I was interrupted from this hasty plan by a pregnant stripper wending through the crowd. Clearly, my decision to seat us on-camera became precipitous as the stripper quickly snaked from the floor to the lap of one of my students. They yelled obscenities at each other while the entire audience screamed and hollered as if attending a cockfight.  I made ineffectual movements of discomfort as the stripper flashed her breasts in what seemed like slow motion, and I felt my heart plummet down into the vibrating floor.  How had everything gotten out of control so quickly, so completely, I wondered&#151;&quot;mouthing&quot; my lines in a completely ineffectual protest?</p>
<p>I had only wanted to bring the students out of the classroom comfort zone and into the experience of the screen; I had only wanted to test our ability to know for certain what was &quot;fake.&quot;  But now we were complicit, I realized, as four of my students questioned the guests.  One student's query about sexually transmitted diseases received chants of &quot;Go to Oprah,&quot; while the more standard-issue insults drew hoots and applause.  After Jerry's &quot;Final Thought&quot; bled into an agonizing forty seconds of clapping, I told the student who had gotten the surprise peep show that he did not have to sign the release form Todd would soon wave at him &#151; a form that I was half convinced would spell the end of my short teaching career.  He gave me a perfectly exaggerated look: why would he not want to be on television? <a href="springer3.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

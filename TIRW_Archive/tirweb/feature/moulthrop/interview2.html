<p><b><font size="1">An interview with Stuart Moulthrop, page 2</font></b></p>
<p><b><img src="scrn2.jpg" width="160" height="480" align="right">NWF: Would you say that, in <i>Pax,</i>the way text builds up (rather than one
chunk replacing another) is an example of conjunctive practice?</b></p>
<p>SM: Actually, the accretive nature of the text has
more to do with instrumentality. What I'm trying to do is provide the player or
reader with more of a stake in the process. And, yes, also escape that
disjunctiveness of moving from node to node.</p>
<p>This started in thoughts about a text that I
haven't yet taken on, and maybe never will. The idea was to create a
stretchtext in which, say, if you stretched a point two thirds of the way
through, changes would happen above that. So you'd have to do this constant
scrolling up and down to see what was happening as you pulled text in or pushed
text out. The idea was to create a body of text that people could hold in their
eyes as well as their minds, so it wouldn't be so much of an &quot;and now
this&quot; experience (thinking of Neil Postman's famous remark about the
grammar of television).</p>
<p><b>NWF: Back to instruments, I remember you saying
recently that instrumental texts offer readers a means of discovering their
affordances, and I was wondering what you meant by that.</b></p>
<p>SM: Well, one of the things that impresses me about
computer games is the way they are able to embed learning structures within
them. And this also reverberates with some of my literary critical training. I
remember discussing certain long poems, and learning how they teach the reader
to read them. This is a famous approach, for example, to the early books of <i>Paradise Lost.</i> It's always
interesting when you see that kind of dynamic happening in a creative work. To
change back to a hypertextual context, it would be nice to have a structure
that's less forbidding, that's less likely to be perceived as destructive if it
needs to be disjunctive. I suppose I've taken to heart the early 1990s
criticism of the late 1980s hypertexts in which people would accuse us of
making purely random connections. I think by inviting people to more deeply
understand the conjunctive process, rather than simply confronting them with
disjunction, we might build more intimacy with the text. And what I have in
mind here is the immersiveness of computer games&#151;even though in the late 80s
I thought games were the devil.</p>
<p>The two turning points for me were the Maxis<i>Sim</i> games&#151;not <i>The Sims, </i>but its ancestors <i>SimCity </i>and a wonderful game
called <i>SimLife</i> which was an
ecological simulator&#151;and, on the quest side of things, <i>Myst. </i>Oddly enough, games
like <i>Myst</i> and <i>7th Guest</i> did a lot to change my
thinking about gaming, even though they were all derivations of the Infocom
model (or the <i>Adventure </i>model) that was very familiar in the 80s and which we
deeply distrusted.</p>
<p><b>NWF: So when you were thinking of your hypertext
literary work as being 'not a game' the kind of game you were thinking of was
more like </b><b><i>Leather Goddesses of Phobos</i></b><b> than it was like </b><b><i>Centipede.</i></b></p>
<p>SM: Certainly. I didn't have arcade games in my
sights. The turf battle we were picking&#151;'we' here including John McDaid,
Michael Joyce, Terry Harpold, and to some extent Jane Douglas&#151;was really with
the Infocom folks. There was an element of rank professional jealousy, for
sure. They had a market, after
all. We were stuck in the garage. In retrospect our allergy to games looks incredibly
foolish, both because Infocom's market experience didn't end all that happily,
and more important because there was so much good work coming out of that
community, and still is.</p>
<p>I suppose what really changed my mind on this was
one of the reception hypertext has sometimes got from the literary community:
&quot;How dare you? You have no place at this club.&quot; The notion that we
could have gotten similarly clubby, trying to exclude someone else's work in
new media, now seems repulsive.</p>
<p><b>NWF: Although I'd say that your work, even as you
become more interested in games, retains some of the characteristics that would
differentiate it from the Infocom work (as well as its predecessors and
descendants). The reader is never the &quot;main character&quot;&#151;however much
hypertext may have been compared to the </b><b><i>Choose-Your-Own-Adventure</i></b><b>books, in fact
Infocom's stuff was much closer to those books&#151;and there's no focus on
puzzle-solving, which I think is central to the enjoyment many people get out
of the Infocom-style work.</b></p>
<p>SM: Actually, <i>Hegirascope </i>was an attempt to do
some puzzle-building. It's a textual maze, though perhaps a poorly-designed one. In the initial scheme
there were two link options on each screen, and the choices were essentially
&quot;extend the current narrative line, retain as much local coherence as
possible&quot; or &quot;spin out.&quot; In the revision I took the link count
up to four on most nodes, and in most cases two of those four are going to keep
you close by, or prolong the reading track. I suppose another way of thinking about
it is as my first attempt at a Cayley instrument. I was hoping that people
would come back into this thing and attempt extended runs through it. I haven't
spoken to a lot of readers of that text, but I don't think many people engage
it in that way. But I thought of <i>Hegirascope </i>as a maze that you
would have to solve to get from beginning to extended end, let's say. There are
premature ending points in that text&#151;four or five&#151;including a multiple
choice quiz where most of the choices are invisible.</p>
<p>Of course, the other aspect of this anxious
relationship to computer games probably parallels the way novelists have felt
about cinema. The competition looks awfully impressive. Computer games are corporate products
created by large teams of extremely talented and intelligent people. I think
this is the golden age for computer games. The talent is so good, and so
untrammeled, right now, but I don't think the good times will last. The game
industry will look more and more like Hollywood (which is already happening)
and as a result the creativity will fall off in the mainstream. Hopefully when
that happens there will be new avenues for independents. And maybe some of those indies will find
themselves in a space that's not too different from the old homestead of
hypertext.</p>
<p><b>NWF: But it will get to the point where the costs
of production are such, and the genres are considered well-known enough, that
people will only take games from pitch through completion if the pitch is,
&quot;This is like </b><b><i>Pretty Woman </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Out of Africa.</i></b><b>&quot;</b></p>
<p>SM: Exactly. <i>The Ten Commandments </i>meets <i>Lolita. </i>Still, it's hard not
to feel that, right now, the real heroes are in the game realm, while what we
do in this curiously electronified literary space is of less importance to
society and less impressive than a masterpiece like <i>Myst</i> or <i>Black and
White.</i> Not to say there aren't some wonderful achievements in electronic literature,
but I guess I would understand their value better if they weren't so much in
the shadow of the literary. I may be partially to blame for this, since I spent
ten years trying very hard to keep us inside a literary fold. I think I still
believe in a literary identity to some extent, but it's certainly the case that
the graphic interactive imagination seems to have more vitality at the moment,
at least for me.</p>
<p><b>NWF: But I think part of what makes us electronic
writers, rather than electronic artists, is that we do love language. </b><b><i>Myst-</i></b><b>like games are
basically language-free, in </b><b><i>The Sims </i></b><b>the characters
speak gibberish&#151;</b><b><i>Black and White </i></b><b>is something of an
exception, but do you think there's the potential for games to move in a
direction more satisfying for literary people?</b></p>
<p>SM: Of course. Right now I'm teaching a course with a
game developer here in Baltimore, Chris Clark, who created a commando
simulation where the way that a character's dialogue was voiced would change
depending on physical state, emotional state, and recent history. So if this
character was buddied up with a character who had just been killed, you'd hear
in her line readings that she'd just lost a friend. This blew people's minds in
the development community&#151;and it came from a sensitivity to language. There
were ten thousand lines of dialogue in this game, which by the way was never
released. The company lost interest.</p>
<p>There's certainly always room for complexity even
in so-called popular forms. Alan Moore, who wrote<i> Watchmen, </i>made a curious remark in an interview once
about the &quot;underlanguage&quot; of comics. He seems to be talking about the
interplay between his verbal text and the visuals. If you know <i>Watchmen, </i>it's full of puns and
ironies. What's in the character dialogue will be echoed or twisted in some way
by what you're seeing.</p>
<p>Maybe something like that coming to new media
would be very interesting. And maybe cybertext is the way to get to that. When
I think of Cayley's<i> What We Will</i>—the QuickTime VR work he collaborated on&#151;I
think that's a pretty strong indication that cybertext could begin to open up
those visual-verbal resonances. <a href="interview3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

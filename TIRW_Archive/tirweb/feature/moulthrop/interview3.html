<p><b>NWF: Well, we have to decide who's definition of
hypertext we're using, but I don't think </b><b><i>What We
Will</i></b><b> would fall outside Nelson's definition. Nelson talks about node-link hypertext
as just one of the types he's interested in, even if it's the one he wrote the
most about. Often I think this cybertext/hypertext distinction is unnecessary.
Unless Nelson is Marx and we're Trotskyites.</b></p>
<p>SM: Oh I think we're sometimes more like
Stalinists. But then Tim Berners-Lee
would have to be Uncle Joe, or maybe Mao, and that doesn't work. He's far too
nice and wouldn't look at all good in khaki.</p>
<p>I've always thought of cybertext as a bigger
tent. Cybertext is a major formulation, which I've said from early on, and
Aarseth has always seen further down the road than I have. This is especially
true with his interest in games, where he was one of the first to sight
land.</p>
<p>Game Studies as Vinland, now that's a thought...</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't think that sectarian distinction,
&quot;this is hypertext, this is cybertext&quot; works very well. All hypertext
is cybertext.</p>
<p><b>NWF: Though Aarseth has made the argument, for example, that <i>afternoon</i> is cybertext and not hypertext because there are guard fields on the links. To his credit, this was a decade ago, when us hypertext folks probably needed our noses tweaked&#151;but this sort of thing reminds me of Toril Moi's observation that when people come up with a definition of the feminist novel that leaves out Virginia Woolf's work, you can only think there's something wrong with their definition.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>SM: I've never much liked the game of categorizing
and defining.Which isn't to say I
haven't tried to play. The joy of putting books on just the right library shelf
has just never gotten to me. The more I find myself engaged as a practitioner
the less I find taxonomies interesting.</p>
<p><b>NWF: Let me ask you one more question about
instrumental texts, then. I'd like to ask it in two ways. First, theoretically,
what do you see as the relationship between instrumental texts and notions of
narrative? Second, to put it in practitioners' terms, what sorts of stories are
you interested in telling in your current work?</b></p>
<p>SM: What's interesting to me about telling stories in
an instrumental context is to see how the stories change. And I don't proceed
top-down with these things. I don't tend to come in with a preconceived notion.
It's been improvisational all the way along.</p>
<p>With <i>Reagan Library</i> I built the visual
world first. In a way it was painted. &quot;Pax&quot; has a bunch of human
figures, and in a way it's sculpted&#151;literally speaking, modeled. It's those
faces and those bodies that really are primary for me, and the stories come
along in the process. The stories came with <i>Reagan Library </i>in fits and starts,
there were a couple of broken attempts that didn't quite come together, but in
the end the stories were there because they needed to be <i>there &#151; </i>in that space<i>. </i>I felt they were
anchored to that visual world in plausible ways.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if what happens in the new work
will be less obsessively connective than the stories in<i> Victory Garden. </i>For that project I had
a tool with which it was very easy to build connections. The linking process,
from the writer's perspective, is both a joy and an addiction. It's a great delight
to say to yourself, &quot;Oh yes! This bit here can be connected with that bit
over there.&quot; So the odd thing about disjunctive hypertext is that to the
writer it doesn't seem disjunctive at all. Because the writer is carrying
around that network of connections inside her head. It doesn't look to the
writer the way it does to the reader. I think where I'm going now&#151;more of
that conjunctive aesthetic&#151;may be less about &quot;linking this to that&quot;
than &quot;placing these things together.&quot;</p>
<p><b>NWF: So will the conjunctive text&#151;the instrument&#151;be
more satisfying to players and readers?</b></p>
<p>SM: Some will, some won't. Maybe some instruments will be hard to play. They may require
practice. Or not. As a teacher once
said to me about the guitar, &quot;After five or ten minutes you'll make sounds
that are almost musical. That's what the frets are for.&quot; And that's a
great virtue of folk instruments. They do allow you to get in touch with a
productive vocabulary very quickly. I think a good instrument would do that. It
would stimulate engagement. It should make people want to get in their and
interact, and to repeat the experience.</p>
<p><b>NWF: Now, there's another sense of instrument,
implicit in what you've said about the guitar, which is the sense of a tool.
There's the sense that people might make many things with instruments once they
become practiced at using them.</b></p>
<p>SM: That's definitely a decent goal. When we can
design things that people apply to their daily informational lives in ways that
they find enlightening or diabolically funny or something then I think we'll
have begun to make a difference. Maybe
then we'll be able to class with the game developers.</p>
<p><b>NWF: So how does &quot;Pax&quot; function as a tool?</b></p>
<p>SM: Maybe it helps us think about other tools, or
about interfaces. In terms of
interface, I've been interested in non-binary control structures, something
Michael Joyce and I both picked up from Peter Bogh Anderson. In the eighties he
deliberately tried to subvert Apple's human interface guidelines by creating
buttons with non-binary function. These
were buttons you had to caress, rub, and scratch&#151;and you'd get different
results from the software by depending on how you treated the interaction
device.</p>
<p>Among the things I'm happiest with in the current
piece are mechanisms of contiguity. The sprites respond to proximity of the
cursor. There are click points. You can
move to things and click on them to elicit action. But the process of
approaching a sprite changes various states. In future works I'd like to remove
the clicks and just work with a grammar of approach.</p>
<p><b>NWF: But &quot;Pax&quot; is about more than interface
tricks...</b></p>
<p>SM: The departure point, in many respects, was four
and half hours I spent at Dallas/Ft. Worth&#151;much of it standing in the rain&#151;because the terminal was cleared for &quot;security&quot; reasons that were
never explained. Maybe someone jumped a
checkpoint. Maybe there was a phone
threat. I did see a guardsman going
down a line of trash bins, probing each one with the business end of his M-16.</p>
<p>We never knew the reason. There was the usual
litany, &quot;An announcement will be made in the general concourse. Please
clear the area.&quot; Then in the concourse, &quot;If you come here you'll have
to go outside, because we can't let you gather here.&quot; So we're standing
outside in the rain, facing off with these very young soldiers in a way that
wasn't entirely unfriendly, though it's hard to think of someone who's holding
an automatic weapon as just another citizen.</p>
<p>Finally, enough of us got so fed up that we
walked over to the troopers and said, &quot;What do you do if thirty of us
decide we want to come in?&quot; And they looked at each other and said,
&quot;You can go talk to our C.O.&quot;</p>
<p>There was nothing in the press about this&#151;this
has just become unreported news. Terminals being shut down, hundreds of people
being introduced to a new way of thinking. </p>
<p><b>NWF: It's training.</b></p>
<p>SM: Yes it is. I had that crowd experience. Finding
yourself standing in a crowd, knowing who you want to listen to, who you want
to talk to. Looking at the body language. All that. There's clearly a set of
instinctual programs that take over and run. You know who the reliable people
are, who are the ones who are going to panic and cause trouble. </p>
<p><b>NWF: And so what you're turning to is writing
about situations. Something like that isn't plot driven.</b></p>
<p>SM: I guess you're right. That's the answer to the
earlier question. I am a lot less creatively invested in the grand architecture
of print fiction, much as I still respect and value it. Or even the
architecture of cinematic storytelling, at least in some of its forms. I'm more
interested in incident, though that's not the only way to go. Maybe there are enough plots in play right
now. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

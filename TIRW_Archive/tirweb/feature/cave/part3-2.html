        <p><b>JW: I wanted to ask a bit about collaboration, which we did touch 
          upon before. I think you've collaborated on all your electronic writing 
          projects? Maybe not <i>The Book of Endings</i>?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes, everything since <i>The Book of Endings</i> has been 
          a collaborative project.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Why?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> First, let me say that I think almost every new media art 
          project is collaborative, and it's often more of a question of how much 
          that is acknowledged or foregrounded or treated as a strength rather 
          than an unfortunate necessity. A project may have been worked on by 
          three people or five people or an entire laboratory, but it can end 
          up credited to one person who brought in the funding or is the most 
          famous or thinks they had the idea. I think, increasingly, we're going 
          to see our field become like theater or film. There will be a very small 
          number of people who write their own script, are their own dramaturge, 
          are the only actor, are the lighting designer, and so on. There are 
          people who do that in theatre and film and there are going to be people 
          who do that in electronic art. But for the most part it's going to be 
          people who are coming at the project from different directions, sharing 
          their thoughts, coming to decisions by various more or less hierarchical 
          means about what will end up in the piece, and then making it happen 
          together. My work has been collaborative because I have wanted to do 
          projects that were going to be better as collaborations than they would 
          have been if I did them on my own, and because I've found people I've 
          wanted to collaborate with, and because I've felt that interdisciplinary 
          collaboration was an important, exciting direction for electronic writing. 
        </p>
        <p><b>JW: Your work is more based on concepts and physical objects than 
          any other electronic literature I can think of, at the same time as 
          the words are very meaningful and present. Do you care whether this 
          is called art or literature? What are your thoughts about that relationship?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> At least at the moment, I think we find a lot of electronic 
          writing is better accepted in the art community than in the writing 
          community. In the art community however it's sometimes seen as being 
          &quot;that really wordy electronic art that takes a long time to consume.&quot; 
          As though John Cayley's work is somehow belabored Jenny Holzer. Nonetheless, 
          I think it is good that there is an interdisciplinary view of new media 
          art that includes writing, and I think it is good that people are doing 
          electronic writing that engages well with the art community. In the 
          long term there's also the disciplinary background that work like mine 
          is coming from, work like Talan Memmott's is coming from, which is important 
          to the work. I say this even though Talan has been a painter and I've 
          worked in a computer science lab. I say this because we've also both 
          been writers and readers. And to repeat something else I've said before: 
          I think the problem might be that electronic art can be in the Whitney, 
          whereas electronic writing can't get a publishing contract from Knopf. 
          So it will be a longer time before the traditional parts of the community 
          accept the electronic work, because it can't occupy the place of pride 
          the rest of the community wants their work to be in. They won't say, 
          &quot;Hey, that got into the place where I wish my work was!&quot; But 
          eventually writing goes where people read, and people don't just read 
          paper any more. Maybe people already don't primarily read paper.</p>
        <p><b>SR: After your experience of teaching at Brown, do you think that 
          teaching electronic writing is the kind of academic job you'd like to 
          have?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> You know, both my parents were academics, and the first 
          real job I had was working at a university. I think that I would probably 
          rather do electronic writing workshops with bright, enthusiastic students, 
          like those I taught at Brown, than most any kind of work. But I know 
          not every teaching situation is as rewarding, and I think I would probably 
          rather be a research scientist like I was at NYU, or maybe any number 
          of other things, than put my energy into teaching people who don't care. 
        </p>
        <p><b>SR: What kinds of assignments did you give your e-writing students 
          when you taught at Brown? Did your students mostly write for the Web, 
          or did you do installation things?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Let's see, there were many different things the students 
          did. One of the student projects I enjoyed was a text that appeared 
          to be an installer script. You ran the program from your command line. 
          He and another student in the class got it running on a number of UNIX 
          variants, which means you can run it on Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and 
          so on. You type something into the command line, and it says &quot;I'm 
          unpacking this, I'm installing that, I'm looking for this,&quot; and 
          then it does the typical thing of throwing up impossible to interpret 
          errors, and then it waits. It does something else and waits. Then it 
          starts being self-reflexive and funny, and telling little stories. Another 
          student created a story in a Yahoo! Mail account. There were messages 
          received by a character in the inbox, the character's responses in the 
          outbox -- but also texts nestled in other places, in the box for unsent 
          drafts, in the filenames of attachments, on items pictured in the attachments 
          themselves. We also used blogs in the class, and some people wrote things 
          that were specific to their blogs. In some ways they were an entry, 
          but in other ways they were playing with the form of an entry to be 
          a writing assignment. There were projects that didn't necessarily have 
          to have an electronic form but that were about thinking through things 
          that are related to electronic media. For example, everyone had to go 
          out and find a game. We did playtesting of the games. Then they had 
          to take the interaction structure of the game and alter it in a way 
          that was appropriate to some particular kind of textual production. 
          They had to talk about the text, and about the change in the game, and 
          then we tried to evaluate the changes in the structure along with the 
          text that was supposed to accompany them. There was no digital implementation 
          of that at all, that was all done on paper. All of which is not to say 
          that people didn't also do things like Flash projects for the class.</p>
        <p><b>SR: I think that's a wrap.</b></p>
        <p><b>JW: Except that we didn't mention Ted Nelson.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, I could talk about my electronic writing definition, 
          and sneak in a mention of Nelson's name.</p>
        <p><b>SR: Yeah, why don't you do that real quick? But make it three minutes 
          or less.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> [laughs] Well, I've been traveling and talking quite a 
          bit, and people ask me what I do. So I say that I work in new media, 
          and that what I mean by new media is &quot;computation used as an expressive 
          medium.&quot; This is what Nick Montfort and I came to when we were 
          working on<i> The New Media Reader</i>. Just as film can be used for 
          data storage (like microfilm) or it can be used as an expressive medium, 
          so the computer can be used for something else (like number crunching) 
          <i>or</i> it can be used as an expressive medium. And I think there's 
          a subtype of new media -- new media as approached by writers -- that 
          I am calling &quot;electronic writing.&quot; My other way of putting 
          that, of defining electronic writing, has been: &quot;writing that requires 
          computation at the time of reading.&quot; At first I ran into controversy 
          involving the term hypertext (and yes, I have a rant about people who 
          use this term without reading Ted Nelson's work), or things like that. 
          But more recently I've had discussions -- and this week, Jill, you witnessed 
          a heated one -- in which people have said, &quot;This is unfair. You're 
          drawing the lines of your club to leave out people who do things like 
          print writing that is generated by a computer program. Those people 
          are deeply addressing computation. They are deeply engaged with digital 
          culture and digital media -- it's just that their work ends up on paper. 
          So your definition is just as exclusionary as many of these other definitions 
          I've heard, which do things like include hypertext but exclude interactive 
          fiction.&quot; I think that's funny, because nobody would say that if 
          our topic were educational materials. They wouldn't say that it's unfair 
          to differentiate and say that you're talking about new media materials, 
          leaving out all materials that are on paper, even though some of them 
          were created using computers that calculated statistical models of the 
          contents. And yet I think that on some level those who object to what 
          I'm saying have a point, it's true that this category may at times be 
          too narrow for the conversation we want to have, and so we also need 
          to think about larger categories -- &quot;digital literature,&quot; 
          for instance, which Roberto Simanowski talks about. He's providing a 
          much bigger tent. Maybe we always need to reference that bigger tent, 
          even when our topic is a more focused one. But I am also unshaken in 
          my belief that just as people in the visual arts, or people who are 
          in music, have types of new media that they identify as coming out of 
          their disciplines, we as writers should embrace electronic writing as 
          new media growing out of our discipline and history -- and we should 
          be proud of it, not berating ourselves for drawing too narrow a boundary, 
          or concerned that its breadth includes writers of web pages, computer 
          games, email narratives, installation artworks, and much more. We can 
          see that text -- along with rules for sequencing, altering, and collaging 
          text -- is increasingly being created for computational media. We can 
          see that reading text -- and hearing text performed, by human or computational 
          voices -- is increasingly happening through a computer that's doing 
          more than just playback. Writing is happening for computational contexts 
          that enable interaction, communication, and transformation. It's our 
          chance to discover written language anew. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"><br>

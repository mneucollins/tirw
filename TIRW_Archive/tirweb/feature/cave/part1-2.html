        <p><b>JW: You force us to think, don't you? That's one of the classic 
          criticisms of electronic literature, that there's no space for contemplation. 
          <i>Screen</i> actually holds you in that contemplative confusion because 
          for the first minutes, there's nothing to do except listen and read.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Right. We've had other electronic artists say to us that 
          there has to be a way for people to interact right from the beginning. 
          &quot;You have to think about what it is that people should be doing 
          to interact at the beginning.&quot; I think Bob has been the person 
          who's most strongly said that what they should be doing at the beginning 
          is listening and reading. That is the interaction they're supposed to 
          be performing! If you give them something else to do they'll do that 
          instead, and that's not the goal of the piece.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The impetus that transformed <i>Screen</i> from being mothballed 
          into being a living piece was this idea that -- you know, the words 
          tearing off the walls didn't really mean anything initially, it was 
          just a gimmick, and then we were brainstorming about what themes could 
          be behind the piece -- there was this idea about the way that memory 
          works. I'd read an article somewhere about how human memory works, and 
          it discussed how when you remember something you don't just play it 
          back. You play it back, and in doing so you re-experience it and then 
          re-encode it, so every time you remember something, you're actually 
          changing the way you remember it. When you've experienced an event with 
          a group of people, and some time passes and you say &quot;Oh, I remember 
          it this way,&quot; and you end up telling a different version of events, 
          it isn't that your memory is faulty, but that that you've actually physically 
          changed your memory over time. Every time you thought about it you tweaked 
          it a little bit. It was this idea that evolved into the idea in <i>Screen</i> 
          of memories encoded as text on the walls which then starts to come apart. 
          You have to participate in actively re-integrating and reconfiguring 
          that text. For me, that idea was the impetus for getting involved in 
          making it a real project. That whole first segment of the story, where 
          you're being passive and just letting experiences happen to you, I think 
          that's integral to that whole arc, that whole story.</p>

        <p><b>JW: Noah, when you were at the art college in Bergen, you showed 
          the DVD of <i>Screen</i>, and I remember one of the students asked you 
          -- what was it again?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> She said, &quot;Where did the text come from for the pieces 
          you showed?&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JW: That's right! And there was this total lack of comprehension 
          that text could be, you know, created. </b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> I think electronic writing is in a weird position. I think 
          the reason that question was asked is that I was scheduled in a speaker 
          series of electronic artists. For the most part that means visual artists, 
          and people whose heritage often comes from something like video art. 
          That's the background that their work is meant to be seen against. I 
          think she really expected my answer to be, &quot;Oh, well, you know, 
          I found this really cool text and it was on the same theme as the project 
          I wanted to do, and so I put it in.&quot; And so for me to say -- &quot;That's 
          my primary art form. When I create electronic art, writing is the field 
          within the arts from which my work grows.&quot;-- it was stunning, I 
          think. That was one of the things Jeremy [Welsh], who invited me, was 
          most pleased with. These were relatively new students and suddenly their 
          whole expectation of what their field was, what electronic art was, 
          got disrupted by having somebody come in and say &quot;I wrote the text.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>SR: Noah, you did much of your earlier work, including <i>The Book 
          of Endings</i> and <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, on the network. How 
          do you feel about <i>Screen</i> only being accessible in one room, at 
          Brown University, and not being able to be distributed as works can 
          be on the Web?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Josh probably has his own answer to this, but in terms 
          of my work, I think it's all still experiments. There may come a time 
          when I feel that I've figured this out and I want to do something based 
          on it and get the maximum number of people to see it, but right now 
          it's all still the figuring. For me a lot of that figuring has to do 
          with really trying to engage whatever medium I'm using. I'm not interested 
          in the web as a distribution platform. I'm interested in the web as 
          an information space, I'm interested in the way browsers work, I'm interested 
          in saying &quot;This is a piece of writing that is connected to <i>this</i> 
          context.&quot; I feel that it's the same working in the Cave. Here we're 
          saying, &quot;What is the Cave?&quot; Maybe you end up doing something 
          with the Cave that people whose answer to that question would be &quot;it's 
          like a head-mounted display, except it's not as heavy on your head&quot; 
          wouldn't. Maybe you end up doing a different kind of work, but it certainly 
          is Cave-specific work. It's work that is about standing in that box 
          and about virtual experience.</p>
        <p>That's my two-fold answer. Whatever medium I'm working with, it's about 
          engaging that medium. The reason it's about engaging that medium is 
          that I'm trying to do a series of different experiments with different 
          media -- and it's because they're experiments that it's OK that very 
          few people see them. I still learn something. </p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We're hoping that it won't just be something that people 
          can only see at Brown University. There are several other Caves out 
          there, and we're trying to make it so that people elsewhere can experience 
          it. I'm interested in the idea that we can find out new things about 
          how interaction works, about what text means, new kinds of behaviors, 
          or perhaps ways that meaning can be intentionally embedded in things 
          in novel ways which could be employed for other purposes that may or 
          may not be artistic. I'm interested in finding out what those side effects 
          will be. We're spending a lot of time working on this piece of art but 
          at the same time we're discovering a lot of things about text, and unexpected 
          ways of interacting with text in this environment. And that could have 
          significant repercussions in other mediums and other applications.</p>

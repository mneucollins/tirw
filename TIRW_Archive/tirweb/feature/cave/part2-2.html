        <p><b>SR: What drew you to the medium after teaching electronic writing 
          workshops primarily using Storyspace and Macromedia software? Why did 
          you want to bring a workshop into this experimental environment?</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Probably the same reason I once made a movie and once got 
          into electronic writing. At first, in all those cases, it was curiosity 
          and wanting the language. And it's always a challenge to see what happens 
          when you move storytelling into an unfamiliar environment. Before I 
          got involved in the first hyperfiction workshop a little over a decade 
          ago, one of my pedagogical goals was to attempt to break young writers 
          out of old workshop habits, the tired conventional well-told-tale habits. 
          To do that I often used to teach a course called &quot;Exemplary Ancient 
          Fictions,&quot; a reading of tales from the Gilgamesh Epic through medieval 
          romance, including the Bible, Greek mythology, Ovid, fairy tales and 
          suchlike. The purpose was to put into play alternative narrative strategies, 
          once popular, now abandoned, so we wrote little one-page fictions in 
          there as well as doing traditional literature-class work like exams 
          and papers. The fiction assignments were linked to modes of storytelling 
          that were exhibited in these other forms. It was modestly successful, 
          but a lot of work. But the first day of class in that pioneer hypertext 
          workshop, I found that many of the goals of that other course were accomplished 
          the minute the screens were turned on -- with the simple discovery, 
          for example, that if you wanted a line you had to draw a line. The new 
          technology simply erased the comforting structures of the old and proposed 
          new ones. So that was an early motivation to continue teaching the workshops 
          -- it was a good pedagogical tool to help people free themselves from 
          stale writing habits. I supposed most of them would go back to print 
          writing, but with a different perception of what it might be to tell 
          a story.</p>
        <p>Then, year by year, as computer memory expanded, new software was developed, 
          the Internet opened up via the new browsers, and hypermedia exploded 
          on the scene, we kept exploring all the new possibilities to see where 
          they might lead us. So, by the time they opened up the Cave at Brown 
          (in 1998), we were ready for it. Even if they were not ready for us. 
          At the opening, I remarked to the Cave's managers that &quot;My writers 
          are going to love that space.&quot; &quot;No, sorry,&quot; they said, 
          &quot;this is strictly a scientific instrument for scientists.&quot; 
          We bided our time and a few years later, when they'd grown accustomed 
          to their toy, I came back to them with something of a quasi-scientific 
          proposal. I offered, firstly, to introduce text -- no one had been using 
          text in there of any kind, visual or audible -- and, secondly, with 
          the notion of voiceovers, sound effects, and music in mind, to hook 
          up their unused speaker system and develop positional sound, and, thirdly, 
          to introduce narrative movement, as opposed to spatial movement through 
          static models, which was the way most of their own projects operated. 
          That worked. They opened the doors to us and we launched our first Cave 
          Writing workshop in the spring of 2002. </p>
        <p>I thought I'd just have a single-semester go and move on, but we're 
          still in there. For one thing, it's a lot of fun, a <i>lot</i> of fun. 
          The excitement of getting something to run in there, and then having 
          other people experience these things, and see the excitement that that 
          generated, that was and continues to be part of the draw. The wow factor. 
          But we also didn't accomplish all that we'd set out to do that first 
          semester, or even very much of it. It was just too hard. We had to work 
          our way through a variety of finger exercises just to figure out how 
          the thing worked, and so came up with a lot more ideas that first semester 
          than finished projects. We also learned the critical importance of creative 
          programmers. Bryant Choung, who's still with us, joined the team that 
          semester, and almost all of our successful pieces, such as <i>Text in 
          Outer Space and Hypertable</i>, dreamt up by writers and artists, were 
          initially built by him.</p>
        <p>The summer following that first semester, with the help of a research 
          grant, the undergraduate artist Vesper Stockwell, programmer Dmitri 
          Lemmerman (also still working with us), and I set about to make a fully 
          elaborate and finished project that would respond fully to our three 
          goals of visible and audible text, positional sound, and narrative movement. 
          This is <i>This Is Just a Place</i>, Vesper's lyrical interpretation 
          of a poem by A. R. Ammons, which not only incorporates all three of 
          those goals, but also introduces such novelties as a prologue, rolling 
          credits, and a restart button -- or stone, as it appears to the user. 
          In it, one goes from dark outer space into a green forest out into a 
          fractal sphere rotating in a blue sky to a petri dish with a tiny squirmy 
          movie in its base and whining, swarming words, thence to a room full 
          of old family photos with ghostly figures that come out at you, and 
          finally to a cemetery, all following the logic and imagery of the poem. 
          Most pros in the field have just never seen anything quite like this 
          and are always pleasantly surprised that the facility can be used in 
          this unexpected way.</p>
        <p><i>Screen</i> was launched that first semester, but was only a set 
          of appealing little technical experiments by Andrew McClain, including 
          word flocking and peeling. Noah picked up on these experiments and came 
          in with an idea for a story that might work with these devices, and 
          the second semester he began working seriously on it, bringing it, with 
          the help of Josh and electronic music composer and sound engineer Shawn 
          Greenlee, to its present state in the research semester that followed. 
          We were in general focused a lot more on content that second year, Talan 
          Memmott's experiments with Josh's help being good examples of that.</p>
        <p>All along, I'd been wanting to get the sound files out of the graphics 
          server and into a separate sound server, believing that sound would 
          be a major key to successful literary projects in there, and needing 
          more flexibility and more memory space for the graphics servers. So 
          I shared out the costs with the Cave managers and, because music students 
          here work primarily on Macs in MAX/MSP, we set up a Mac server. Consequently, 
          this past semester, our third official workshop, with the help of electronic 
          music composers Jason Moore and Tom Owen, we've focused much more on 
          sound, tinkering with old projects like <i>This Is Just a Place</i> 
          and <i>Screen</i>, developing new elements in projects like <i>Hypertable</i>, 
          and launching new positional sound experiments, most notably in <i>Telephone 
          Flat</i>, the party sound-story, which uses an elegant complex model 
          created by Edwin Chang. New projects like Talan's <i>Spread</i> and 
          William Gillespie's <i>Word Museum</i> will also experiment with sound.

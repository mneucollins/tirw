        <p><b>Introduction-Cavewriting</b></p>
        <p>Push aside the thick, dark curtain, step across the cables on the floor 
          and you'll find yourself standing on a white floor with white screens 
          in front of you and to each of your sides. Above you are projectors 
          and speakers. You're given a pair of goggles and a glove. You put them 
          on and wait for <i>Screen</i> to begin. The space darkens. A voice begins 
          to read: &quot;In a world of illusions, we hold ourselves in place by 
          memories.&quot; In the dark there is nothing for you to do but listen. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Screen </i>is a literary work that can only be experienced in a 
          Cave. In a Cave, images-or in the case of <i>Screen</i>, words-are projected 
          on all three walls and on the floor. When you stand in the Cave wearing 
          goggles, you experience the projected images as a three dimensional 
          space in which you can move around. The goggles and glove allow the 
          Cave to track your position, so you can control the environment by moving 
          your body and your hand.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>
            <p>Light over the sill of an unshaded<br>
              bedroom window, into a woman's eyes.<br>
              She turns away, slips half back under sleep.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Words cover the three screens in the Cave and are read aloud as you 
          follow them with your eyes. Each wall's words describe a double moment 
          in time, a woman or a man remembering and feeling the memory slip away, 
          hidden by the present.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>She uncurls her arm,<br>
              reaches back to lay her hand across<br>
              his thigh, to welcome him home,<br>
              but touches only a ridge of sheet, <br>
              sun warmed, empty.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&quot;We hold ourselves in place by memories,&quot; the first voice 
          reads to you in the dark. These narrated memories refuse to stay still. 
          After the voices have read the text aloud the words start to peel off 
          the walls. You can try to catch them with your gloved hand, and for 
          a while you may succeed in forcing them back where they belong, but 
          before too long the words crash all around you. This experience in virtual 
          reality is very different from the Holodeck vision of total immersion 
          in a make-believe world. <i>Screen</i> does not attempt to replicate 
          a real-world environment, but instead immerses the user in a reflexive 
          literary representation, one in which words and narrative remain predominant.</p>
        <p><i>Screen</i> was created collaboratively by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrew 
          McClain, Shawn Greenlee, Robert Coover, and Josh Carroll. They developed 
          the piece in the <a href="http://www.cascv.brown.edu/cavewriting/workshop.html" target="_blank">Cave 
          Writing Workshop at Brown University</a>, which is led by Robert Coover. 
          In December we visited the Cave and were able to experience several 
          works created in the workshop, including <i>Screen</i>, as well as Vesper 
          Stockwell, Dmitri Lemmerman, et al's &quot;This is Just a Place,&quot; 
          an interpretation of a poem by A.R. Ammons; &quot;Hypertable;&quot; 
          and a work in progress, set in a local flat. After the Cave demo, we 
          spoke with Joshua Carroll, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, and Robert Coover. The 
          interview is divided into three sections: in the first we discuss the 
          specific experience of collaborating on <i>Screen</i> with Josh and 
          Noah, in the second Robert Coover discusses the Cave writing workshops 
          in the context of his experience teaching electronic writing at Brown, 
          and in the third we discuss <i>Screen</i> with Noah in the context of 
          his other work in electronic writing. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Jill Walker: When did you start working on the project?</b></p>
        <p><b>Noah Wardrip-Fruin:</b> We started in Bob Coover's first Cave Writing 
          workshop, which was in Spring 2002. Bob was able to arrange access to 
          this facility that previously had only been used at Brown for various 
          kinds of scientific computing. We had assembled an interdisciplinary 
          group and Bob's idea was to start by trying out little ideas. So we 
          were trying out ideas like the cube with text inside, as you saw, just 
          tiny narrative moments. One of those narrative moments was words flocking 
          around each other. Another narrative moment was words peeling off a 
          wall. Both of these were created by an undergraduate named Andrew McClain. 
          Andrew was focused on computer science and theater, and in a way these 
          were small dramatic moments. But neither had any user interaction, and 
          neither had any meaningful text. So I met with Andrew and said, &quot;I'm 
          interested in writing some text for these, and in us developing them 
          into a coherent piece, with the swarming happening around the body, 
          and introducing tracking of the hand to enable hitting the words back 
          in place, or into different places.&quot; And then, working with Bob, 
          I began to develop texts that worked virtual experience, touch, and 
          memory. Shawn Greenlee joined the project and began creating the sound 
          environment. Then we all continued to talk about those themes, and about 
          those elements, and by the end of that first semester we had the initial 
          &quot;design document.&quot; But it wasn't until the next semester, 
          when Josh came aboard, that we got further -- producing the first complete 
          version of the project. Once that happened we were able to more fully 
          understand what we were getting at, and so we produced a significantly 
          different text (including Bob's introduction and epilogue, which I believe 
          are his first pieces of writing for electronic media), changed the behavior 
          of the walls and other elements, and, until a few days ago, continued 
          experimenting with the pacing until we developed the experience arc 
          the piece has now. </p>
        <p><b>Scott Rettberg: How was the work on <i>Screen</i> divided, and what 
          roles did you and the other people involved play? How did the collaboration 
          work?</b></p>
        <p><b>Joshua Carroll:</b> We never really explicitly divided the work. 
          Whoever was best adapted to doing what needed to be done did it. I was 
          best suited to programming, but when the team got together we would 
          discuss the concept at all levels and brainstorm new possibilities. 
          Everyone's basic ideas about the piece coalesced fairly quickly: its 
          overall arc of activity, its essential look and feel, but we constantly 
          debated the subtleties and the piece consequently continued and continues 
          to evolve. As for who did what -- that kind of 'just happened', there 
          was never an explicit declaration of who was going to be responsible 
          for what.</p>
        <p><b>NWF</b>: Of course there's also an inevitable division of labor. 
          If there was something Josh thought could be better about the text, 
          he didn't say &quot;Noah, I've got a new draft of the text.&quot; [Josh 
          laughs] He said, &quot;Noah, maybe you should try X or Y.&quot; If there 
          was something like the timing we were just working on, I didn't say, 
          &quot;Josh, you know, I went in and I threw away your old version of 
          the code and I put in the way I wanted the timing to work, tell me what 
          you think.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> When Professor Coover originally organized the workshop, 
          he assembled an equal numbers of writers, modelers, sound people, and 
          engineers; so it was by definition interdisciplinary, and that made 
          it an ideal environment for these sorts of discussions to happen. Everybody 
          had a discrete area of expertise which they could feel comfortable sharing, 
          and so no one really felt threatened in terms of sharing ideas and finding 
          areas to contribute. </p>
        <p><b>SR: It seems that text in the Cave is working against the grain 
          of the media. Can you talk about the way <i>Screen</i> works against 
          our expectations?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> We had a visual art professor come here. <i>Screen</i> 
          started, he looked around, and he said, &quot;Why isn't this using the 
          medium?&quot; He literally got a chair and sat outside the Cave to watch. 
          And he acted almost put upon, I would say. Then the first word peeled 
          off the wall and he leapt from his chair like something had tipped it 
          over! I think we like that element of surprise, in both ways. There's 
          a shock that the Cave isn't being used to create some sort of artificial 
          landscape for you to fly over, but rather it's being used a box, and 
          it's being used as a box with text on the wall, instead of pictures. 
          And then we like the surprise when that is disrupted.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We've talked at times about giving more cues to people about 
          what they're supposed to do when the words rip off the walls, or starting 
          <i>Screen</i> in 3-D, because people say if you're going to do a project 
          for the Cave it should be more richly 3-D from the outset. But we've 
          always ended up shelving those ideas, because they would completely 
          rob the piece of the surprising quality it has -- that sense of being 
          taken out of where you thought you were. </p>
        <p><b>JW: You force us to think, don't you? That's one of the classic 
          criticisms of electronic literature, that there's no space for contemplation. 
          <i>Screen</i> actually holds you in that contemplative confusion because 
          for the first minutes, there's nothing to do except listen and read.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Right. We've had other electronic artists say to us that 
          there has to be a way for people to interact right from the beginning. 
          &quot;You have to think about what it is that people should be doing 
          to interact at the beginning.&quot; I think Bob has been the person 
          who's most strongly said that what they should be doing at the beginning 
          is listening and reading. That is the interaction they're supposed to 
          be performing! If you give them something else to do they'll do that 
          instead, and that's not the goal of the piece.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The impetus that transformed <i>Screen</i> from being mothballed 
          into being a living piece was this idea that -- you know, the words 
          tearing off the walls didn't really mean anything initially, it was 
          just a gimmick, and then we were brainstorming about what themes could 
          be behind the piece -- there was this idea about the way that memory 
          works. I'd read an article somewhere about how human memory works, and 
          it discussed how when you remember something you don't just play it 
          back. You play it back, and in doing so you re-experience it and then 
          re-encode it, so every time you remember something, you're actually 
          changing the way you remember it. When you've experienced an event with 
          a group of people, and some time passes and you say &quot;Oh, I remember 
          it this way,&quot; and you end up telling a different version of events, 
          it isn't that your memory is faulty, but that that you've actually physically 
          changed your memory over time. Every time you thought about it you tweaked 
          it a little bit. It was this idea that evolved into the idea in <i>Screen</i> 
          of memories encoded as text on the walls which then starts to come apart. 
          You have to participate in actively re-integrating and reconfiguring 
          that text. For me, that idea was the impetus for getting involved in 
          making it a real project. That whole first segment of the story, where 
          you're being passive and just letting experiences happen to you, I think 
          that's integral to that whole arc, that whole story.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Noah, when you were at the art college in Bergen, you showed 
          the DVD of <i>Screen</i>, and I remember one of the students asked you 
          -- what was it again?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> She said, &quot;Where did the text come from for the pieces 
          you showed?&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JW: That's right! And there was this total lack of comprehension 
          that text could be, you know, created. </b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> I think electronic writing is in a weird position. I think 
          the reason that question was asked is that I was scheduled in a speaker 
          series of electronic artists. For the most part that means visual artists, 
          and people whose heritage often comes from something like video art. 
          That's the background that their work is meant to be seen against. I 
          think she really expected my answer to be, &quot;Oh, well, you know, 
          I found this really cool text and it was on the same theme as the project 
          I wanted to do, and so I put it in.&quot; And so for me to say--&quot;That's 
          my primary art form. When I create electronic art, writing is the field 
          within the arts from which my work grows.&quot;--it was stunning, I 
          think. That was one of the things Jeremy [Welsh], who invited me, was 
          most pleased with. These were relatively new students and suddenly their 
          whole expectation of what their field was, what electronic art was, 
          got disrupted by having somebody come in and say &quot;I wrote the text.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>SR: Noah, you did much of your earlier work, including <i>The Book 
          of Endings</i> and <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, on the network. How 
          do you feel about <i>Screen</i> only being accessible in one room, at 
          Brown University, and not being able to be distributed as works can 
          be on the Web?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Josh probably has his own answer to this, but in terms 
          of my work, I think it's all still experiments. There may come a time 
          when I feel that I've figured this out and I want to do something based 
          on it and get the maximum number of people to see it, but right now 
          it's all still the figuring. For me a lot of that figuring has to do 
          with really trying to engage whatever medium I'm using. I'm not interested 
          in the web as a distribution platform. I'm interested in the web as 
          an information space, I'm interested in the way browsers work, I'm interested 
          in saying &quot;This is a piece of writing that is connected to <i>this</i> 
          context.&quot; I feel that it's the same working in the Cave. Here we're 
          saying, &quot;What is the Cave?&quot; Maybe you end up doing something 
          with the Cave that people whose answer to that question would be &quot;it's 
          like a head-mounted display, except it's not as heavy on your head&quot; 
          wouldn't. Maybe you end up doing a different kind of work, but it certainly 
          is Cave-specific work. It's work that is about standing in that box 
          and about virtual experience.</p>
        <p>That's my two-fold answer. Whatever medium I'm working with, it's about 
          engaging that medium. The reason it's about engaging that medium is 
          that I'm trying to do a series of different experiments with different 
          media -- and it's because they're experiments that it's OK that very 
          few people see them. I still learn something. </p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We're hoping that it won't just be something that people 
          can only see at Brown University. There are several other Caves out 
          there, and we're trying to make it so that people elsewhere can experience 
          it. I'm interested in the idea that we can find out new things about 
          how interaction works, about what text means, new kinds of behaviors, 
          or perhaps ways that meaning can be intentionally embedded in things 
          in novel ways which could be employed for other purposes that may or 
          may not be artistic. I'm interested in finding out what those side effects 
          will be. We're spending a lot of time working on this piece of art but 
          at the same time we're discovering a lot of things about text, and unexpected 
          ways of interacting with text in this environment. And that could have 
          significant repercussions in other mediums and other applications.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>----</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>JW: Leading this workshop, you've taken a hands-on role on the projects?</b></p>
        <p><b>Robert Coover:</b> Yes.</p>
        <p><b>NWF: Your role has been more than just oversight.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> It's exploratory collaborative work, and I'd say the role 
          I've played has been something like producer/director. The pieces are 
          workshopped as in all writing workshops, and I play the usual directorial 
          role of critiquing and advancing the projects, but I also have to watch 
          budgets and manage expectations. Anything is possible in there, but 
          not everything is practical or affordable. These are teams of students, 
          not professionals, so it is a learning experience for all of us, including 
          our young programmers. We pay for coding and some modeling and sound 
          engineering, so we have to estimate in advance the amount of hours required. 
          A pro might get something accomplished in one expensive hour that our 
          relatively inexperienced programmers need four or five less expensive 
          hours to do, learning as they go. Moreover, given the need for the graphic 
          servers to read the trackers and continually reload the stereo images 
          of any given project at a terrific speed, there is a significant memory 
          limitation. Finely pixilated intricate models can eat up a lot of memory 
          and make things pretty stuttery in there.</p>
        <p><b>SR: It sounds like it's important to have all the collaborators 
          actually working together in the Cave. I could see that being a problem, 
          where a writer comes into the space with a great idea but no realistic 
          notion of how to implement it.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Designers too, because most young artists, like most young 
          writers, have not actually attempted any hard coding or modeled anything 
          in 3D, so they often underestimate the work involved, work that has 
          to be paid for on a very limited budget. There's the desire, for example, 
          to bring realistic-looking people into an interactive story or poem. 
          But each one of those models, if articulated and individualized, would 
          take an enormous amount of time to build and then get into motion, and 
          then they would not likely work all that well anyway, in part because 
          of the memory limitations of the ceaselessly reloading graphics server. 
          Maybe ten years down the road, one will be able to keep a whole stable 
          of virtual actors in a file folder, and you'll be able to select from 
          the model-base as you would actors from a casting agency, then layer 
          on eccentricities and costume them with a mouseclick and send them out 
          to play in multitudes, but right now everything has to be built, element 
          by element, from the ground up within the strict limitations of the 
          servers. So I encourage people to try to keep things relatively simple, 
          using texture mapping instead of intricate modeling where possible, 
          achieving their effects by means other than the attempted imitation 
          of the real world, using their own imaginations to challenge and stimulate 
          the imaginations of others. Thus, the forest that comes out of the night 
          sky and surrounds you in <i>This Is Just a Place</i>, which you've just 
          seen, is merely a texture-mapped cube, but there's a seeming depth to 
          the photo imagery, you hear the sounds of crickets and perhaps the faint 
          fall of rain as it breaks around you, and it feels convincing enough 
          to express a forest, even if it doesn't deliver it tree by tree. If 
          we'd spent a year or two modeling a whole forest, it likely would not 
          have felt that much more forestlike than the existing version.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The Cave was built as a scientific visualization facility, 
          so the things that has been modeled in there are things that we have 
          no traditional visual experience with: proteins, subatomic particles, 
          the surface of Mars, or some ancient temple -- these are things that 
          we've never seen before. You have no context, so you don't have that 
          jarring impact -- you don't mind if your model of snake venom protein 
          resembles a blob of soap bubbles. But when you're trying to do something 
          like a workshop story, to represent everyday life and everyday objects, 
          you have so much familiarity with them that you can't do it in the usual 
          way that it would be done in the Cave.</p>
        <p><b>SR: So maybe it's not mimesis that you're after anyway.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> It isn't, absolutely not. Virtual reality is in reality 
          virtual artificiality. In fact that's one of its principal charms. In 
          a way, the more realistic it gets in there, the less interesting it 
          is.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The Cave was built as a scientific visualization facility, 
          so the stuff that has been modeled in there is nothing that you have 
          traditional visual experience with: proteins, subatomic particles, the 
          surface of Mars, or some ancient temple -- these are things that you've 
          never seen before. You have no context, so you don't have that jarring 
          impact -- you don't mind if your model of snake venom protein resembles 
          a blob of soap bubbles. But when you're trying to do something like 
          a workshop story, to represent everyday life and objects, you have so 
          much familiarity with them that you can't do it in the traditional way 
          that it would be done in the Cave.</p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> That's a good point. A conventional fiction workshop story 
          is not the kind of thing that works well in there. Of course, it's my 
          feeling that conventional fiction workshop stories don't work all that 
          well in fiction workshops either. But this is a wondrous imaginative 
          interactive space where marvels can happen and the imagination can be 
          turned loose all around you. Abstraction works well in there, especially 
          in virtual deep space. Metaphoric and symbolic suggestion do. Theatrical 
          material -- it is a kind of stage, after all: you bring your elements 
          on stage and interact with them, immersing yourself in your own drama, 
          your own story.</p>
        <p>As for the seeming real, I've been convinced from the first time we 
          put anything up in there that what reality one is likely to achieve 
          in virtual reality can best be delivered by sound. Sound expands the 
          space vastly; it can move into the Cave and leave it, can be attached 
          to and enrich an object or a portion of the space, as you, as user, 
          transport yourself past or through it. In that party scene, for example, 
          you hear people talking both in the space you momentarily occupy and 
          beyond it in the ambient party chatter. It is a sound story in the making 
          and though the persons speaking are not visible, even as simple 2D models, 
          they seem to be more there than the beautifully elaborate but make-believe 
          model of the flat itself.</p>
        <p><b>SR: What drew you to the medium after teaching electronic writing 
          workshops primarily using Storyspace and Macromedia software? Why did 
          you want to bring a workshop into this experimental environment?</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Probably the same reason I once made a movie and once got 
          into electronic writing. At first, in all those cases, it was curiosity 
          and wanting the language. And it's always a challenge to see what happens 
          when you move storytelling into an unfamiliar environment. Before I 
          got involved in the first hyperfiction workshop a little over a decade 
          ago, one of my pedagogical goals was to attempt to break young writers 
          out of old workshop habits, the tired conventional well-told-tale habits. 
          To do that I often used to teach a course called &quot;Exemplary Ancient 
          Fictions,&quot; a reading of tales from the Gilgamesh Epic through medieval 
          romance, including the Bible, Greek mythology, Ovid, fairy tales and 
          suchlike. The purpose was to put into play alternative narrative strategies, 
          once popular, now abandoned, so we wrote little one-page fictions in 
          there as well as doing traditional literature-class work like exams 
          and papers. The fiction assignments were linked to modes of storytelling 
          that were exhibited in these other forms. It was modestly successful, 
          but a lot of work. But the first day of class in that pioneer hypertext 
          workshop, I found that many of the goals of that other course were accomplished 
          the minute the screens were turned on -- with the simple discovery, 
          for example, that if you wanted a line you had to draw a line. The new 
          technology simply erased the comforting structures of the old and proposed 
          new ones. So that was an early motivation to continue teaching the workshops 
          -- it was a good pedagogical tool to help people free themselves from 
          stale writing habits. I supposed most of them would go back to print 
          writing, but with a different perception of what it might be to tell 
          a story.</p>
        <p>Then, year by year, as computer memory expanded, new software was developed, 
          the Internet opened up via the new browsers, and hypermedia exploded 
          on the scene, we kept exploring all the new possibilities to see where 
          they might lead us. So, by the time they opened up the Cave at Brown 
          (in 1998), we were ready for it. Even if they were not ready for us. 
          At the opening, I remarked to the Cave's managers that &quot;My writers 
          are going to love that space.&quot; &quot;No, sorry,&quot; they said, 
          &quot;this is strictly a scientific instrument for scientists.&quot; 
          We bided our time and a few years later, when they'd grown accustomed 
          to their toy, I came back to them with something of a quasi-scientific 
          proposal. I offered, firstly, to introduce text -- no one had been using 
          text in there of any kind, visual or audible -- and, secondly, with 
          the notion of voiceovers, sound effects, and music in mind, to hook 
          up their unused speaker system and develop positional sound, and, thirdly, 
          to introduce narrative movement, as opposed to spatial movement through 
          static models, which was the way most of their own projects operated. 
          That worked. They opened the doors to us and we launched our first Cave 
          Writing workshop in the spring of 2002. </p>
        <p>I thought I'd just have a single-semester go and move on, but we're 
          still in there. For one thing, it's a lot of fun, a <i>lot</i> of fun. 
          The excitement of getting something to run in there, and then having 
          other people experience these things, and see the excitement that that 
          generated, that was and continues to be part of the draw. The wow factor. 
          But we also didn't accomplish all that we'd set out to do that first 
          semester, or even very much of it. It was just too hard. We had to work 
          our way through a variety of finger exercises just to figure out how 
          the thing worked, and so came up with a lot more ideas that first semester 
          than finished projects. We also learned the critical importance of creative 
          programmers. Bryant Choung, who's still with us, joined the team that 
          semester, and almost all of our successful pieces, such as <i>Text in 
          Outer Space and Hypertable</i>, dreamt up by writers and artists, were 
          initially built by him.</p>
        <p>The summer following that first semester, with the help of a research 
          grant, the undergraduate artist Vesper Stockwell, programmer Dmitri 
          Lemmerman (also still working with us), and I set about to make a fully 
          elaborate and finished project that would respond fully to our three 
          goals of visible and audible text, positional sound, and narrative movement. 
          This is <i>This Is Just a Place</i>, Vesper's lyrical interpretation 
          of a poem by A. R. Ammons, which not only incorporates all three of 
          those goals, but also introduces such novelties as a prologue, rolling 
          credits, and a restart button -- or stone, as it appears to the user. 
          In it, one goes from dark outer space into a green forest out into a 
          fractal sphere rotating in a blue sky to a petri dish with a tiny squirmy 
          movie in its base and whining, swarming words, thence to a room full 
          of old family photos with ghostly figures that come out at you, and 
          finally to a cemetery, all following the logic and imagery of the poem. 
          Most pros in the field have just never seen anything quite like this 
          and are always pleasantly surprised that the facility can be used in 
          this unexpected way.</p>
        <p><i>Screen</i> was launched that first semester, but was only a set 
          of appealing little technical experiments by Andrew McClain, including 
          word flocking and peeling. Noah picked up on these experiments and came 
          in with an idea for a story that might work with these devices, and 
          the second semester he began working seriously on it, bringing it, with 
          the help of Josh and electronic music composer and sound engineer Shawn 
          Greenlee, to its present state in the research semester that followed. 
          We were in general focused a lot more on content that second year, Talan 
          Memmott's experiments with Josh's help being good examples of that.</p>
        <p>All along, I'd been wanting to get the sound files out of the graphics 
          server and into a separate sound server, believing that sound would 
          be a major key to successful literary projects in there, and needing 
          more flexibility and more memory space for the graphics servers. So 
          I shared out the costs with the Cave managers and, because music students 
          here work primarily on Macs in MAX/MSP, we set up a Mac server. Consequently, 
          this past semester, our third official workshop, with the help of electronic 
          music composers Jason Moore and Tom Owen, we've focused much more on 
          sound, tinkering with old projects like <i>This Is Just a Place</i> 
          and <i>Screen</i>, developing new elements in projects like <i>Hypertable</i>, 
          and launching new positional sound experiments, most notably in <i>Telephone 
          Flat</i>, the party sound-story, which uses an elegant complex model 
          created by Edwin Chang. New projects like Talan's <i>Spread</i> and 
          William Gillespie's <i>Word Museum</i> will also experiment with sound.</p>
        <p><b>SR:</b> So does the project then stop here, or does it become part 
          of the curriculum of electronic writing at Brown?</p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> I'm not sure, that remains something of an unresolved mystery. 
          The prospect of a permanent electronic writing position here is one 
          of those on-again-off-again things, and even should it happen, there's 
          no certainty the person chosen would be particularly interested in playing 
          in immersive 3D. Meanwhile, though I'm not scheduled to teach again 
          until the spring of 2006, I'll at least be here through midwinter, working 
          with a small research team headed up by the electronic poet John Cayley, 
          tidying up old projects and getting them safely archived while launching 
          a new project or two, including innovative new work by John. I do hope 
          the Cave Writing workshop continues. It has been very useful in drawing 
          us much closer to the Computer Science department, and the university 
          now does feel this is something for which they receive a lot of national 
          and international recognition, so I think they'd like to see it carry 
          on. Andy Van Dam, the professor who was largely responsible for bringing 
          the Cave to Brown and who is now Vice President in charge of research, 
          very much wants to see the Cave become, not just a narrowly employed 
          scientific tool, but a widely used university facility, so we're not 
          without support. Our next goal would be to create collaborative workshops 
          with Writing, Music, Computer Science, and RISD's New Media program. 
          So Cave Writing's future is both bright and uncertain. It has enthusiastic 
          support, but right now I'm the only one teaching the course, and I'm 
          headed off for a long spell, so six weeks or so from now, it could all 
          be over.</p>
        <p><b>SR:</b> Something that's occurred to me, thinking back to your essay 
          &quot;Literary Hypertext: The Passing of the Golden Age,&quot; is that 
          one of the frustrations you expressed there with the Web is that it's 
          this sort of distractive environment, where you can easily be drawn 
          away from a story. In that respect, one of the advantages of software 
          like Storyspace is that it's a standalone application, rather than content 
          in a browser of an immense network. I'm wondering if there's something 
          appealing to you about the literal immersiveness of the Cave environment.</p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Well, there is something compelling about being wrapped 
          in your own creation. We speak of the user and the user's experience, 
          but in fact it's the maker of the piece who really has the most exhilarating 
          experience. I'm reminded somewhat of theater rehearsals when, as author 
          or director, you're onstage amid your actors, your characters, all your 
          words come alive around you. The Cave is similarly collaborative, too, 
          which might frustrate some writers, but which I often find rewarding, 
          especially given the talent you find yourself working with. Also, I 
          have to confess, I've always been fascinated by optical illusions like 
          3D. As a kid, I used to make my own 3D comics with red and green inks. 
          This is an incomparably better inkpot.</p>
        <p>The writing itself in here is often more like script writing than story 
          writing, except for the dialogue or voiceovers: precise and clear instructions 
          to programmers, modelers, artists, and engineers. There's a lot of work 
          involved in building a literary project that has little to do with the 
          writing to be read or heard. Noah's writing for <i>Screen</i> got done 
          pretty quickly, but we still had a long time to go after that before 
          the piece would work as a literary experience. Which it is. A literary 
          experience. It dismisses all the pretty graphics associated with VR 
          and leaves you in a space which is really 2D for quite a while, nothing 
          but text on the literal Cave walls, something like posters of text. 
          The user/reader is lured into this, partly because of the sound track 
          and the compelling voices over, reading the texts aloud, partly simply 
          because of the intriguing prose itself. Then suddenly the whole thing 
          becomes interactive in a very unexpected yet meaningful way, the very 
          2D-ness of it coming apart, and the absorption becomes total without 
          losing any of the text's intentions or impact. I've seen it hundreds 
          of times, and I still get a charge out of it. Just last night, we spent 
          hours getting the timing right for the way the words peel off the walls 
          en route to the climax, and when we managed it, there was a real rush 
          of pleasure, and partly because now it &quot;read&quot; right.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Is it closer to performance than most other literature, then?</b></p>
        <p>RC: Well, at least as a writing space, it's a different thing from 
          performance, though of course it can be a literal performance. Jeffrey 
          Shaw has a piece, for instance, that presents the user not with a wand 
          or joystick but with a life-size wooden puppet mounted in the very center 
          of the Cave itself. Its articulated joints all contain sensors, even 
          the fingers, and the user, wearing glasses, creates a surrounding flow 
          of imagery by manipulating the puppet, twisting and working the joints. 
          The more you abuse the puppet, the more exciting the imagery, so you 
          find yourself bending it upside down, stretching the limbs apart, pushing 
          back the fingers, twisting the neck, doing, in effect, creative violence 
          to it. It's possible to have an audience sitting at the periphery with 
          glasses on, watching the show, as though sitting at the edge of a theater 
          proscenium. In our Cave, we now have the sound server and graphics server 
          speaking to each other, so we're hoping to create sound-and-graphics 
          compositions that are driven by midi instruments. These too could be 
          performed in or out of the Cave for an audience. So certainly it has 
          performance potential. But for writers, it's more like building a little 
          interactive literary world around yourself, and then, in an intimate 
          one-on-one sort of way, inviting readers in to experience what you've 
          written.</p>
        <p><b>JW:</b> What's it like when you're all working together? It seems 
          there are many different kinds of work involved, and a lot of it. Are 
          you all sort of looking over each other's shoulders at the screen?</p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> For all the collaboration involved, much of the work in 
          there is accomplished like any other artistic work: alone. The various 
          tasks are accomplished, pretty much in isolation, and then assembled. 
          Only when it comes together when you're in demo mode is there an over-the-shoulder 
          relationship. The programmers especially have to spend a lot of time 
          quietly ticky-tacking away on their own. None of the rest of us can 
          really read what they're writing, and once they have in mind what they're 
          trying to do, we're pretty much in the way. A little gesture gets accomplished, 
          we all gather and admire and critique it and then we separate again. 
          Creative programmers are the key players on any Cave Writing project 
          team. There's really not much comparison here in theater or film. They 
          are genuine co-authors. There's a growing rapport between computer programmers 
          and all the other art forms, but it's especially closely felt between 
          text writers and code writers: we both spend a lot of time at keyboards 
          trying to make artful things happen, and in the Cave we very much need 
          each other. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>JW: Do you find people actually read what you write? That sounds 
          rude, doesn't it! It sounds terrible!</b></p>
        <p>NWF: It's not rude at all! Clearly, I'm not writing in spaces that 
          encourage the kinds of reading one gets from print readers. If that's 
          what we mean by <i>actually reading</i> then people don't do it with 
          what I write. But I think other kinds of reading are possible, and worth 
          exploring. Take a piece like <i>Talking Cure</i>. In that piece I was 
          writing for the textual space created by Camille Utterback's &quot;Written 
          Forms&quot; video processing technique. This technique posterizes a 
          live video image down to three colors -- and the dark, medium, and light 
          areas of video each reveal the corresponding parts of three different 
          full-screen texts. It looks like a normal full-screen text until someone 
          is in front of the camera -- in the reading space. Once there's a reader 
          the different texts are continually blending on the horizontal plane 
          -- so left-to-right reading will produce a collage -- and people often 
          read the text in more vertical color patches produced by the video image 
          (which means words from one text, but not in the usual line-based groupings). 
          For <i>Talking Cure</i> I wanted to write something about word pictures, 
          about the gaze, about the kinds of things that Camille's technique brings 
          up. I wanted to write something for that kind of reading, not for the 
          kind to which we're accustomed. So I was doing my composition in strange 
          ways -- running the text of all three screens parallel to each other, 
          line by line, in my text editor, so I could be creating the sorts of 
          blending and border opportunities I wanted. Also I tried to compose 
          with an eye toward what would happen in semi-vertical patches. It was 
          a challenge. But I think people read it, and often for longer, with 
          more surprise, and more intense interest in the possibilities of the 
          language there than I can imagine if I'd put it on even the nicest paper. 
          A couple of people have even slowly, methodically, used their hands 
          to scan across the whole field of the camera and read individual layers 
          in isolation -- but that's probably an artifact of paper reading. </p>
        <p><i>Screen</i>, on the other hand, actually does ask for some of that 
          traditional, paper-style reading. That's what's happening through the 
          whole first section of the piece -- we're projecting text in a traditional 
          paragraph shape onto the wall as though you aren't in a VR space. But 
          then the words start to peel loose, and the reading of individual words 
          as they peel, as they fly around, as you hit them with your hand, this 
          is a new type of reading. And then, peripherally, there's also the reading 
          of the alterations that are taking place in the wall text as words, 
          or parts of words, end up in different places than where they started.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Peripheral reading, that's a great concept. That's rather like 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, isn't it: things happen around the edges 
          of what the reader is focused on. Is that something you think about?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes. Text has to be different to live in the electronic 
          environment, and I think being peripherally situated in relation to 
          some &quot;primary&quot; information-work task is a textual situation 
          to which I'll probably return. I think <i>The Impermanence Agent's</i> 
          relation to web browsing worked well. But this is not to say that I'm 
          not interested in the physical environment. I could imagine putting 
          text on walls, or in other parts of the physical environment. And I 
          have been thinking about a piece that would end up on that classic physical 
          medium, paper, probably in the form of a map. But to return to your 
          question, yes, I'm interested in things that are experienced peripherally, 
          and I'm interested in things that you play indirectly. People do play 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, but they play it much more indirectly 
          than they play <i>Talking Cure</i>. </p>
        <p><b>JW: A lot of people talk about the network and about its being electronic, 
          but this point about its being peripheral is less emphasized. It's something 
          a lot of people have been anxious about, you know, the lack of attention, 
          and here you're saying that that's what you're aiming at.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> There are things on my computer that I pay the old-fashioned 
          attention to -- for example, when I'm reading a news story in my Web 
          browser, I pay attention to it once and then it's gone. But the things 
          that are on my screen, perhaps covered by other things, or partially 
          obscured, or over in a corner, the things that are there for a long 
          time are the things that really inhabit my electronic environment and 
          are specific to it, rather than just an importing.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Your latest works, <i>Talking Cure</i> and <i>Screen</i>, are 
          very much installation works in a physical space that you can't take 
          home.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> If there's any thread that runs through everything I've 
          done -- and you could argue with me and say &quot;you know, there isn't,&quot; 
          but if there is -- it is that I'm trying to be specific to and investigate 
          whatever medium I work with. <i>The Impermanence Agent </i>is about 
          browser specific, Web specific artwork. The Cave is the specific space 
          for <i>Screen</i>. No, <i>Screen</i> is not part of your day-to-day

        <p><b>SR: How was working with print writers in the MFA workshop at Brown? 
          Were you writing for print, writing print for works that would become 
          electronic, or presenting electronic work to writers who worked only 
          in print?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, when I was an undergrad, I went and spent a month 
          at Irvine. I was working with a writer there, and one of the things 
          I did was hang around the MFA workshops. There were interesting people 
          there, certainly, but it seemed to me that, at that moment, what they 
          were trying to do was very similar. They were all trying to write a 
          certain kind of literary fiction and get an advance for it. It became 
          clear as I got more and more involved in electronic writing that it 
          wouldn't be pursuable in a program like that. Brown is a program for 
          freaks and misfits. In the first fiction writing workshop that I took 
          at Brown, I was the only person who was writing in a computational form, 
          but another writer turned in an audio tape, and everyone got a copy 
          of the audio tape and everyone listened to it and we critiqued it -- 
          that was his fiction practice. A different person turned something in 
          that was on videotape. Many people turned things in that were collage 
          oriented, really trying to explore the space of paper, and some of those 
          were irreproducible. So I didn't feel out of place at all in the MFA 
          program. Also there was very little emphasis on traditional publication. 
          Students who expressed interest in immediate publication in fact might 
          get told by the faculty &quot;I hope that you won't take the time that 
          we're paying you to be here to write a bunch of letters to publishers 
          or agents, I hope you'll use it to explore work that you wouldn't be 
          able to explore if you had to have another job, or if you felt pressured 
          to get published. I hope you'll use this time to do strange work you'd 
          never do otherwise and find out whether there's some other place for 
          you to go, rather than pursuing what you already know.&quot; So in an 
          environment like that, electronic writing was the weird misfit activity 
          I was up to, and it was no different from the weird misfit activities 
          other people were doing or are being encouraged to find and try. Also, 
          Brown's long history in electronic writing and interdisciplinary collaboration 
          gives some indication of the environment. After all, Ted Nelson and 
          Andy van Dam created a hypertext system at Brown in the 1960s, when 
          computers were still basically seen as number crunchers. And Bob and 
          others have been doing electronic writing workshops and research projects 
          at Brown through the writing program, continually, for nearly 15 years.</p>
        <p>Which is an answer to only part of your question. The answer to the 
          other part of your question is -- because of that encouragement, because 
          of that model, I viewed being in a workshop with someone like Carole 
          Maso as an opportunity to encounter her as an artist and teacher. My 
          electronic work was happening somewhere else. She would say &quot;I 
          want you to write something that has the structure of a symphony, and 
          I want you to figure out what you're going to mean by the structure 
          of a symphony, because <i>you're</i> going to have to mean it.&quot; 
          So we each went and did our different research about what we thought 
          a symphonic structure and fiction writing might have that could connect 
          them. Nobody was doing something that was meant for print or non-print 
          publication, we were just exploring the idea of a symphony. Some of 
          the things that came out of those experiences did end up connecting 
          with my electronic writing. An exercise in Carole's class produced a 
          sentence that was the beginning of the first draft of the text that 
          became <i>Screen</i>.</p>
        <p><b>JW: I wanted to ask a bit about collaboration, which we did touch 
          upon before. I think you've collaborated on all your electronic writing 
          projects? Maybe not <i>The Book of Endings</i>?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes, everything since <i>The Book of Endings</i> has been 
          a collaborative project.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Why?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> First, let me say that I think almost every new media art 
          project is collaborative, and it's often more of a question of how much 
          that is acknowledged or foregrounded or treated as a strength rather 
          than an unfortunate necessity. A project may have been worked on by 
          three people or five people or an entire laboratory, but it can end 
          up credited to one person who brought in the funding or is the most 
          famous or thinks they had the idea. I think, increasingly, we're going 
          to see our field become like theater or film. There will be a very small 
          number of people who write their own script, are their own dramaturge, 
          are the only actor, are the lighting designer, and so on. There are 
          people who do that in theatre and film and there are going to be people 
          who do that in electronic art. But for the most part it's going to be 
          people who are coming at the project from different directions, sharing 
          their thoughts, coming to decisions by various more or less hierarchical 
          means about what will end up in the piece, and then making it happen 
          together. My work has been collaborative because I have wanted to do 
          projects that were going to be better as collaborations than they would 
          have been if I did them on my own, and because I've found people I've 
          wanted to collaborate with, and because I've felt that interdisciplinary 
          collaboration was an important, exciting direction for electronic writing. 
        </p>
        <p><b>JW: Your work is more based on concepts and physical objects than 
          any other electronic literature I can think of, at the same time as 
          the words are very meaningful and present. Do you care whether this 
          is called art or literature? What are your thoughts about that relationship?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> At least at the moment, I think we find a lot of electronic 
          writing is better accepted in the art community than in the writing 
          community. In the art community however it's sometimes seen as being 
          &quot;that really wordy electronic art that takes a long time to consume.&quot; 
          As though John Cayley's work is somehow belabored Jenny Holzer. Nonetheless, 
          I think it is good that there is an interdisciplinary view of new media 
          art that includes writing, and I think it is good that people are doing 
          electronic writing that engages well with the art community. In the 
          long term there's also the disciplinary background that work like mine 
          is coming from, work like Talan Memmott's is coming from, which is important 
          to the work. I say this even though Talan has been a painter and I've 
          worked in a computer science lab. I say this because we've also both 
          been writers and readers. And to repeat something else I've said before: 
          I think the problem might be that electronic art can be in the Whitney, 
          whereas electronic writing can't get a publishing contract from Knopf. 
          So it will be a longer time before the traditional parts of the community 
          accept the electronic work, because it can't occupy the place of pride 
          the rest of the community wants their work to be in. They won't say, 
          &quot;Hey, that got into the place where I wish my work was!&quot; But 
          eventually writing goes where people read, and people don't just read 
          paper any more. Maybe people already don't primarily read paper.</p>
        <p><b>SR: After your experience of teaching at Brown, do you think that 
          teaching electronic writing is the kind of academic job you'd like to 
          have?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> You know, both my parents were academics, and the first 
          real job I had was working at a university. I think that I would probably 
          rather do electronic writing workshops with bright, enthusiastic students, 
          like those I taught at Brown, than most any kind of work. But I know 
          not every teaching situation is as rewarding, and I think I would probably 
          rather be a research scientist like I was at NYU, or maybe any number 
          of other things, than put my energy into teaching people who don't care. 
        </p>
        <p><b>SR: What kinds of assignments did you give your e-writing students 
          when you taught at Brown? Did your students mostly write for the Web, 
          or did you do installation things?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Let's see, there were many different things the students 
          did. One of the student projects I enjoyed was a text that appeared 
          to be an installer script. You ran the program from your command line. 
          He and another student in the class got it running on a number of UNIX 
          variants, which means you can run it on Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and 
          so on. You type something into the command line, and it says &quot;I'm 
          unpacking this, I'm installing that, I'm looking for this,&quot; and 
          then it does the typical thing of throwing up impossible to interpret 
          errors, and then it waits. It does something else and waits. Then it 
          starts being self-reflexive and funny, and telling little stories. Another 
          student created a story in a Yahoo! Mail account. There were messages 
          received by a character in the inbox, the character's responses in the 
          outbox -- but also texts nestled in other places, in the box for unsent 
          drafts, in the filenames of attachments, on items pictured in the attachments 
          themselves. We also used blogs in the class, and some people wrote things 
          that were specific to their blogs. In some ways they were an entry, 
          but in other ways they were playing with the form of an entry to be 
          a writing assignment. There were projects that didn't necessarily have 
          to have an electronic form but that were about thinking through things 
          that are related to electronic media. For example, everyone had to go 
          out and find a game. We did playtesting of the games. Then they had 
          to take the interaction structure of the game and alter it in a way 
          that was appropriate to some particular kind of textual production. 
          They had to talk about the text, and about the change in the game, and 
          then we tried to evaluate the changes in the structure along with the 
          text that was supposed to accompany them. There was no digital implementation 
          of that at all, that was all done on paper. All of which is not to say 
          that people didn't also do things like Flash projects for the class.</p>
        <p><b>SR: I think that's a wrap.</b></p>
        <p><b>JW: Except that we didn't mention Ted Nelson.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, I could talk about my electronic writing definition, 
          and sneak in a mention of Nelson's name.</p>
        <p><b>SR: Yeah, why don't you do that real quick? But make it three minutes 
          or less.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> [laughs] Well, I've been traveling and talking quite a 
          bit, and people ask me what I do. So I say that I work in new media, 
          and that what I mean by new media is &quot;computation used as an expressive 
          medium.&quot; This is what Nick Montfort and I came to when we were 
          working on<i> The New Media Reader</i>. Just as film can be used for 
          data storage (like microfilm) or it can be used as an expressive medium, 
          so the computer can be used for something else (like number crunching) 
          <i>or</i> it can be used as an expressive medium. And I think there's 
          a subtype of new media -- new media as approached by writers -- that 
          I am calling &quot;electronic writing.&quot; My other way of putting 
          that, of defining electronic writing, has been: &quot;writing that requires 
          computation at the time of reading.&quot; At first I ran into controversy 
          involving the term hypertext (and yes, I have a rant about people who 
          use this term without reading Ted Nelson's work), or things like that. 
          But more recently I've had discussions -- and this week, Jill, you witnessed 
          a heated one -- in which people have said, &quot;This is unfair. You're 
          drawing the lines of your club to leave out people who do things like 
          print writing that is generated by a computer program. Those people 
          are deeply addressing computation. They are deeply engaged with digital 
          culture and digital media -- it's just that their work ends up on paper. 
          So your definition is just as exclusionary as many of these other definitions 
          I've heard, which do things like include hypertext but exclude interactive 
          fiction.&quot; I think that's funny, because nobody would say that if 
          our topic were educational materials. They wouldn't say that it's unfair 
          to differentiate and say that you're talking about new media materials, 
          leaving out all materials that are on paper, even though some of them 
          were created using computers that calculated statistical models of the 
          contents. And yet I think that on some level those who object to what 
          I'm saying have a point, it's true that this category may at times be 
          too narrow for the conversation we want to have, and so we also need 
          to think about larger categories -- &quot;digital literature,&quot; 
          for instance, which Roberto Simanowski talks about. He's providing a 
          much bigger tent. Maybe we always need to reference that bigger tent, 
          even when our topic is a more focused one. But I am also unshaken in 
          my belief that just as people in the visual arts, or people who are 
          in music, have types of new media that they identify as coming out of 
          their disciplines, we as writers should embrace electronic writing as 
          new media growing out of our discipline and history -- and we should 
          be proud of it, not berating ourselves for drawing too narrow a boundary, 
          or concerned that its breadth includes writers of web pages, computer 
          games, email narratives, installation artworks, and much more. We can 
          see that text -- along with rules for sequencing, altering, and collaging 
          text -- is increasingly being created for computational media. We can 
          see that reading text -- and hearing text performed, by human or computational 
          voices -- is increasingly happening through a computer that's doing 
          more than just playback. Writing is happening for computational contexts 
          that enable interaction, communication, and transformation. It's our 
          chance to discover written language anew.<br>

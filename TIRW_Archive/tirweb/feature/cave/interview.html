        <p><b>Jill Walker: When did you start working on the project?</b></p>
        <p><b>Noah Wardrip-Fruin:</b> We started in Bob Coover's first Cave Writing 
          workshop, which was in Spring 2002. Bob was able to arrange access to 
          this facility that previously had only been used at Brown for various 
          kinds of scientific computing. We had assembled an interdisciplinary 
          group and Bob's idea was to start by trying out little ideas. So we 
          were trying out ideas like the cube with text inside, as you saw, just 
          tiny narrative moments. One of those narrative moments was words flocking 
          around each other. Another narrative moment was words peeling off a 
          wall. Both of these were created by an undergraduate named Andrew McClain. 
          Andrew was focused on computer science and theater, and in a way these 
          were small dramatic moments. But neither had any user interaction, and 
          neither had any meaningful text. So I met with Andrew and said, &quot;I'm 
          interested in writing some text for these, and in us developing them 
          into a coherent piece, with the swarming happening around the body, 
          and introducing tracking of the hand to enable hitting the words back 
          in place, or into different places.&quot; And then, working with Bob, 
          I began to develop texts that worked virtual experience, touch, and 
          memory. Shawn Greenlee joined the project and began creating the sound 
          environment. Then we all continued to talk about those themes, and about 
          those elements, and by the end of that first semester we had the initial 
          &quot;design document.&quot; But it wasn't until the next semester, 
          when Josh came aboard, that we got further -- producing the first complete 
          version of the project. Once that happened we were able to more fully 
          understand what we were getting at, and so we produced a significantly 
          different text (including Bob's introduction and epilogue, which I believe 
          are his first pieces of writing for electronic media), changed the behavior 
          of the walls and other elements, and, until a few days ago, continued 
          experimenting with the pacing until we developed the experience arc 
          the piece has now. </p>
        <p><b>Scott Rettberg: How was the work on <i>Screen</i> divided, and what 
          roles did you and the other people involved play? How did the collaboration 
          work?</b></p>
        <p><b>Joshua Carroll:</b> We never really explicitly divided the work. 
          Whoever was best adapted to doing what needed to be done did it. I was 
          best suited to programming, but when the team got together we would 
          discuss the concept at all levels and brainstorm new possibilities. 
          Everyone's basic ideas about the piece coalesced fairly quickly: its 
          overall arc of activity, its essential look and feel, but we constantly 
          debated the subtleties and the piece consequently continued and continues 
          to evolve. As for who did what -- that kind of 'just happened', there was 
          never an explicit declaration of who was going to be responsible for 
          what.</p>
        <p><b>NWF</b>: Of course there's also an inevitable division of labor. 
          If there was something Josh thought could be better about the text, 
          he didn't say &quot;Noah, I've got a new draft of the text.&quot; [Josh 
          laughs] He said, &quot;Noah, maybe you should try X or Y.&quot; If there 
          was something like the timing we were just working on, I didn't say, 
          &quot;Josh, you know, I went in and I threw away your old version of 
          the code and I put in the way I wanted the timing to work, tell me what 
          you think.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> When Professor Coover originally organized the workshop, 
          he assembled an equal numbers of writers, modelers, sound people, and 
          engineers; so it was by definition interdisciplinary, and that made 
          it an ideal environment for these sorts of discussions to happen. Everybody 
          had a discrete area of expertise which they could feel comfortable sharing, 
          and so no one really felt threatened in terms of sharing ideas and finding 
          areas to contribute. </p>
        <p><b>SR: It seems that text in the Cave is working against the grain 
          of the media. Can you talk about the way <i>Screen</i> works against 
          our expectations?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> We had a visual art professor come here. <i>Screen</i> 
          started, he looked around, and he said, &quot;Why isn't this using the 
          medium?&quot; He literally got a chair and sat outside the Cave to watch. 
          And he acted almost put upon, I would say. Then the first word peeled 
          off the wall and he leapt from his chair like something had tipped it 
          over! I think we like that element of surprise, in both ways. There's 
          a shock that the Cave isn't being used to create some sort of artificial 
          landscape for you to fly over, but rather it's being used a box, and 
          it's being used as a box with text on the wall, instead of pictures. 
          And then we like the surprise when that is disrupted.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We've talked at times about giving more cues to people about 
          what they're supposed to do when the words rip off the walls, or starting 
          <i>Screen</i> in 3-D, because people say if you're going to do a project 
          for the Cave it should be more richly 3-D from the outset. But we've 
          always ended up shelving those ideas, because they would completely 
          rob the piece of the surprising quality it has -- that sense of being 
          taken out of where you thought you were. </p>
        <p><b>JW: You force us to think, don't you? That's one of the classic 
          criticisms of electronic literature, that there's no space for contemplation. 
          Screen actually holds you in that contemplative confusion because for 
          the first minutes, there's nothing to do except listen and read.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Right. We've had other electronic artists say to us that 
          there has to be a way for people to interact right from the beginning. 
          &quot;You have to think about what it is that people should be doing 
          to interact at the beginning.&quot; I think Bob has been the person 
          who's most strongly said that what they should be doing at the beginning 
          is listening and reading. That is the interaction they're supposed to 
          be performing! If you give them something else to do they'll do that 
          instead, and that's not the goal of the piece.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The impetus that transformed Screen from being mothballed 
          into being a living piece was this idea that -- you know, the words tearing 
          off the walls didn't really mean anything initially, it was just a gimmick, 
          and then we were brainstorming about what themes could be behind the 
          piece -- there was this idea about the way that memory works. I'd read 
          an article somewhere about how human memory works, and it discussed 
          how when you remember something you don't just play it back. You play 
          it back, and in doing so you re-experience it and then re-encode it, 
          so every time you remember something, you're actually changing the way 
          you remember it. When you've experienced an event with a group of people, 
          and some time passes and you say &quot;Oh, I remember it this way,&quot; 
          and you end up telling a different version of events, it isn't that 
          your memory is faulty, but that that you've actually physically changed 
          your memory over time. Every time you thought about it you tweaked it 
          a little bit. It was this idea that evolved into the idea in Screen 
          of memories encoded as text on the walls which then starts to come apart. 
          You have to participate in actively re-integrating and reconfiguring 
          that text. For me, that idea was the impetus for getting involved in 
          making it a real project. That whole first segment of the story, where 
          you're being passive and just letting experiences happen to you, I think 
          that's integral to that whole arc, that whole story.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Noah, when you were at the art college in Bergen, you showed 
          the DVD of Screen, and I remember one of the students asked you -- what 
          was it again?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> She said, &quot;Where did the text come from for the pieces 
          you showed?&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JW: That's right! And there was this total lack of comprehension 
          that text could be, you know, created. </b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> I think electronic writing is in a weird position. I think 
          the reason that question was asked is that I was scheduled in a speaker 
          series of electronic artists. For the most part that means visual artists, 
          and people whose heritage often comes from something like video art. 
          That's the background that their work is meant to be seen against. I 
          think she really expected my answer to be, &quot;Oh, well, you know, 
          I found this really cool text and it was on the same theme as the project 
          I wanted to do, and so I put it in.&quot; And so for me to say--&quot;That's 
          my primary art form. When I create electronic art, writing is the field 
          within the arts from which my work grows.&quot;--it was stunning, I 
          think. That was one of the things Jeremy [Welsh], who invited me, was 
          most pleased with. These were relatively new students and suddenly their 
          whole expectation of what their field was, what electronic art was, 
          got disrupted by having somebody come in and say &quot;I wrote the text.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>SR: Noah, you did much of your earlier work, including <i>The Book 
          of Endings</i> and <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, on the network. How 
          do you feel about <i>Screen</i> only being accessible in one room, at 
          Brown University, and not being able to be distributed as works can 
          be on the Web?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Josh probably has his own answer to this, but in terms 
          of my work, I think it's all still experiments. There may come a time 
          when I feel that I've figured this out and I want to do something based 
          on it and get the maximum number of people to see it, but right now 
          it's all still the figuring. For me a lot of that figuring has to do 
          with really trying to engage whatever medium I'm using. I'm not interested 
          in the web as a distribution platform. I'm interested in the web as 
          an information space, I'm interested in the way browsers work, I'm interested 
          in saying &quot;This is a piece of writing that is connected to <i>this</i> 
          context.&quot; I feel that it's the same working in the Cave. Here we're 
          saying, &quot;What is the Cave?&quot; Maybe you end up doing something 
          with the Cave that people whose answer to that question would be &quot;it's 
          like a head-mounted display, except it's not as heavy on your head&quot; 
          wouldn't. Maybe you end up doing a different kind of work, but it certainly 
          is Cave-specific work. It's work that is about standing in that box 
          and about virtual experience.</p>
        <p>That's my two-fold answer. Whatever medium I'm working with, it's about 
          engaging that medium. The reason it's about engaging that medium is 
          that I'm trying to do a series of different experiments with different 
          media -- and it's because they're experiments that it's OK that very few 
          people see them. I still learn something. </p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We're hoping that it won't just be something that people 
          can only see at Brown University. There are several other Caves out 
          there, and we're trying to make it so that people elsewhere can experience 
          it. I'm interested in the idea that we can find out new things about 
          how interaction works, about what text means, new kinds of behaviors, 
          or perhaps ways that meaning can be intentionally embedded in things 
          in novel ways which could be employed for other purposes that may or 
          may not be artistic. I'm interested in finding out what those side effects 
          will be. We're spending a lot of time working on this piece of art but 
          at the same time we're discovering a lot of things about text, and unexpected 
          ways of interacting with text in this environment. And that could have 
          significant repercussions in other mediums and other applications.</p>

        <p><b>JW: Do you find people actually read what you write? That sounds 
          rude, doesn't it! It sounds terrible!</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> It's not rude at all! Clearly, I'm not writing in spaces 
          that encourage the kinds of reading one gets from print readers. If 
          that's what we mean by <i>actually reading</i> then people don't do 
          it with what I write. But I think other kinds of reading are possible, 
          and worth exploring. Take a piece like <i>Talking Cure</i>. In that 
          piece I was writing for the textual space created by Camille Utterback's 
          &quot;Written Forms&quot; video processing technique. This technique 
          posterizes a live video image down to three colors -- and the dark, 
          medium, and light areas of video each reveal the corresponding parts 
          of three different full-screen texts. It looks like a normal full-screen 
          text until someone is in front of the camera -- in the reading space. 
          Once there's a reader the different texts are continually blending on 
          the horizontal plane -- so left-to-right reading will produce a collage 
          -- and people often read the text in more vertical color patches produced 
          by the video image (which means words from one text, but not in the 
          usual line-based groupings). For <i>Talking Cure</i> I wanted to write 
          something about word pictures, about the gaze, about the kinds of things 
          that Camille's technique brings up. I wanted to write something for 
          that kind of reading, not for the kind to which we're accustomed. So 
          I was doing my composition in strange ways -- running the text of all 
          three screens parallel to each other, line by line, in my text editor, 
          so I could be creating the sorts of blending and border opportunities 
          I wanted. Also I tried to compose with an eye toward what would happen 
          in semi-vertical patches. It was a challenge. But I think people read 
          it, and often for longer, with more surprise, and more intense interest 
          in the possibilities of the language there than I can imagine if I'd 
          put it on even the nicest paper. A couple of people have even slowly, 
          methodically, used their hands to scan across the whole field of the 
          camera and read individual layers in isolation -- but that's probably 
          an artifact of paper reading. </p>
        <p><i>Screen</i>, on the other hand, actually does ask for some of that 
          traditional, paper-style reading. That's what's happening through the 
          whole first section of the piece -- we're projecting text in a traditional 
          paragraph shape onto the wall as though you aren't in a VR space. But 
          then the words start to peel loose, and the reading of individual words 
          as they peel, as they fly around, as you hit them with your hand, this 
          is a new type of reading. And then, peripherally, there's also the reading 
          of the alterations that are taking place in the wall text as words, 
          or parts of words, end up in different places than where they started.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Peripheral reading, that's a great concept. That's rather like 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, isn't it: things happen around the edges 
          of what the reader is focused on. Is that something you think about?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes. Text has to be different to live in the electronic 
          environment, and I think being peripherally situated in relation to 
          some &quot;primary&quot; information-work task is a textual situation 
          to which I'll probably return. I think <i>The Impermanence Agent's</i> 
          relation to web browsing worked well. But this is not to say that I'm 
          not interested in the physical environment. I could imagine putting 
          text on walls, or in other parts of the physical environment. And I 
          have been thinking about a piece that would end up on that classic physical 
          medium, paper, probably in the form of a map. But to return to your 
          question, yes, I'm interested in things that are experienced peripherally, 
          and I'm interested in things that you play indirectly. People do play 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, but they play it much more indirectly 
          than they play <i>Talking Cure</i>. </p>
        <p><b>JW: A lot of people talk about the network and about its being electronic, 
          but this point about its being peripheral is less emphasized. It's something 
          a lot of people have been anxious about, you know, the lack of attention, 
          and here you're saying that that's what you're aiming at.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> There are things on my computer that I pay the old-fashioned 
          attention to -- for example, when I'm reading a news story in my Web 
          browser, I pay attention to it once and then it's gone. But the things 
          that are on my screen, perhaps covered by other things, or partially 
          obscured, or over in a corner, the things that are there for a long 
          time are the things that really inhabit my electronic environment and 
          are specific to it, rather than just an importing.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Your latest works, <i>Talking Cure</i> and <i>Screen</i>, are 
          very much installation works in a physical space that you can't take 
          home.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> If there's any thread that runs through everything I've 
          done -- and you could argue with me and say &quot;you know, there isn't,&quot; 
          but if there is -- it is that I'm trying to be specific to and investigate 
          whatever medium I work with. <i>The Impermanence Agent </i>is about 
          browser specific, Web specific artwork. The Cave is the specific space 
          for <i>Screen</i>. No, <i>Screen</i> is not part of your day-to-day 
          information life at all. It really is a place where you go and pay that 
          old-fashioned kind of attention.</p>
        <p><b>SR: How was working with print writers in the MFA workshop at Brown? 
          Were you writing for print, writing print for works that would become 
          electronic, or presenting electronic work to writers who worked only 
          in print?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, when I was an undergrad, I went and spent a month 
          at Irvine. I was working with a writer there, and one of the things 
          I did was hang around the MFA workshops. There were interesting people 
          there, certainly, but it seemed to me that, at that moment, what they 
          were trying to do was very similar. They were all trying to write a 
          certain kind of literary fiction and get an advance for it. It became 
          clear as I got more and more involved in electronic writing that it 
          wouldn't be pursuable in a program like that. Brown is a program for 
          freaks and misfits. In the first fiction writing workshop that I took 
          at Brown, I was the only person who was writing in a computational form, 
          but another writer turned in an audio tape, and everyone got a copy 
          of the audio tape and everyone listened to it and we critiqued it -- 
          that was his fiction practice. A different person turned something in 
          that was on videotape. Many people turned things in that were collage 
          oriented, really trying to explore the space of paper, and some of those 
          were irreproducible. So I didn't feel out of place at all in the MFA 
          program. Also there was very little emphasis on traditional publication. 
          Students who expressed interest in immediate publication in fact might 
          get told by the faculty &quot;I hope that you won't take the time that 
          we're paying you to be here to write a bunch of letters to publishers 
          or agents, I hope you'll use it to explore work that you wouldn't be 
          able to explore if you had to have another job, or if you felt pressured 
          to get published. I hope you'll use this time to do strange work you'd 
          never do otherwise and find out whether there's some other place for 
          you to go, rather than pursuing what you already know.&quot; So in an 
          environment like that, electronic writing was the weird misfit activity 
          I was up to, and it was no different from the weird misfit activities 
          other people were doing or are being encouraged to find and try. Also, 
          Brown's long history in electronic writing and interdisciplinary collaboration 
          gives some indication of the environment. After all, Ted Nelson and 
          Andy van Dam created a hypertext system at Brown in the 1960s, when 
          computers were still basically seen as number crunchers. And Bob and 
          others have been doing electronic writing workshops and research projects 
          at Brown through the writing program, continually, for nearly 15 years.</p>
        <p>Which is an answer to only part of your question. The answer to the 
          other part of your question is -- because of that encouragement, because 
          of that model, I viewed being in a workshop with someone like Carole 
          Maso as an opportunity to encounter her as an artist and teacher. My 
          electronic work was happening somewhere else. She would say &quot;I 
          want you to write something that has the structure of a symphony, and 
          I want you to figure out what you're going to mean by the structure 
          of a symphony, because <i>you're</i> going to have to mean it.&quot; 
          So we each went and did our different research about what we thought 
          a symphonic structure and fiction writing might have that could connect 
          them. Nobody was doing something that was meant for print or non-print 
          publication, we were just exploring the idea of a symphony. Some of 
          the things that came out of those experiences did end up connecting 
          with my electronic writing. An exercise in Carole's class produced a 
          sentence that was the beginning of the first draft of the text that 
          became <i>Screen</i>. <a href="part3-2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        <p><b>SR: So does the project then stop here, or does it become part of 
          the curriculum of electronic writing at Brown?</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> I'm not sure, that remains something of an unresolved mystery. 
          The prospect of a permanent electronic writing position here is one 
          of those on-again-off-again things, and even should it happen, there's 
          no certainty the person chosen would be particularly interested in playing 
          in immersive 3D. Meanwhile, though I'm not scheduled to teach again 
          until the spring of 2006, I'll at least be here through midwinter, working 
          with a small research team headed up by the electronic poet John Cayley, 
          tidying up old projects and getting them safely archived while launching 
          a new project or two, including innovative new work by John. I do hope 
          the Cave Writing workshop continues. It has been very useful in drawing 
          us much closer to the Computer Science department, and the university 
          now does feel this is something for which they receive a lot of national 
          and international recognition, so I think they'd like to see it carry 
          on. Andy Van Dam, the professor who was largely responsible for bringing 
          the Cave to Brown and who is now Vice President in charge of research, 
          very much wants to see the Cave become, not just a narrowly employed 
          scientific tool, but a widely used university facility, so we're not 
          without support. Our next goal would be to create collaborative workshops 
          with Writing, Music, Computer Science, and RISD's New Media program. 
          So Cave Writing's future is both bright and uncertain. It has enthusiastic 
          support, but right now I'm the only one teaching the course, and I'm 
          headed off for a long spell, so six weeks or so from now, it could all 
          be over.</p>
        <p><b>SR: Something that's occurred to me, thinking back to your essay 
          &quot;Literary Hypertext: The Passing of the Golden Age,&quot; is that 
          one of the frustrations you expressed there with the Web is that it's 
          this sort of distractive environment, where you can easily be drawn 
          away from a story. In that respect, one of the advantages of software 
          like Storyspace is that it's a standalone application, rather than content 
          in a browser of an immense network. I'm wondering if there's something 
          appealing to you about the literal immersiveness of the Cave environment.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Well, there is something compelling about being wrapped 
          in your own creation. We speak of the user and the user's experience, 
          but in fact it's the maker of the piece who really has the most exhilarating 
          experience. I'm reminded somewhat of theater rehearsals when, as author 
          or director, you're onstage amid your actors, your characters, all your 
          words come alive around you. The Cave is similarly collaborative, too, 
          which might frustrate some writers, but which I often find rewarding, 
          especially given the talent you find yourself working with. Also, I 
          have to confess, I've always been fascinated by optical illusions like 
          3D. As a kid, I used to make my own 3D comics with red and green inks. 
          This is an incomparably better inkpot.</p>
        <p>The writing itself in here is often more like script writing than story 
          writing, except for the dialogue or voiceovers: precise and clear instructions 
          to programmers, modelers, artists, and engineers. There's a lot of work 
          involved in building a literary project that has little to do with the 
          writing to be read or heard. Noah's writing for <i>Screen</i> got done 
          pretty quickly, but we still had a long time to go after that before 
          the piece would work as a literary experience. Which it is. A literary 
          experience. It dismisses all the pretty graphics associated with VR 
          and leaves you in a space which is really 2D for quite a while, nothing 
          but text on the literal Cave walls, something like posters of text. 
          The user/reader is lured into this, partly because of the sound track 
          and the compelling voices over, reading the texts aloud, partly simply 
          because of the intriguing prose itself. Then suddenly the whole thing 
          becomes interactive in a very unexpected yet meaningful way, the very 
          2D-ness of it coming apart, and the absorption becomes total without 
          losing any of the text's intentions or impact. I've seen it hundreds 
          of times, and I still get a charge out of it. Just last night, we spent 
          hours getting the timing right for the way the words peel off the walls 
          en route to the climax, and when we managed it, there was a real rush 
          of pleasure, and partly because now it &quot;read&quot; right.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Is it closer to performance than most other literature, then?</b></p>
        <p>RC: Well, at least as a writing space, it's a different thing from 
          performance, though of course it can be a literal performance. Jeffrey 
          Shaw has a piece, for instance, that presents the user not with a wand 
          or joystick but with a life-size wooden puppet mounted in the very center 
          of the Cave itself. Its articulated joints all contain sensors, even 
          the fingers, and the user, wearing glasses, creates a surrounding flow 
          of imagery by manipulating the puppet, twisting and working the joints. 
          The more you abuse the puppet, the more exciting the imagery, so you 
          find yourself bending it upside down, stretching the limbs apart, pushing 
          back the fingers, twisting the neck, doing, in effect, creative violence 
          to it. It's possible to have an audience sitting at the periphery with 
          glasses on, watching the show, as though sitting at the edge of a theater 
          proscenium. In our Cave, we now have the sound server and graphics server 
          speaking to each other, so we're hoping to create sound-and-graphics 
          compositions that are driven by midi instruments. These too could be 
          performed in or out of the Cave for an audience. So certainly it has 
          performance potential. But for writers, it's more like building a little 
          interactive literary world around yourself, and then, in an intimate 
          one-on-one sort of way, inviting readers in to experience what you've 
          written.</p>
        <p><b>JW: What's it like when you're all working together? It seems there 
          are many different kinds of work involved, and a lot of it. Are you 
          all sort of looking over each other's shoulders at the screen?</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> For all the collaboration involved, much of the work in 
          there is accomplished like any other artistic work: alone. The various 
          tasks are accomplished, pretty much in isolation, and then assembled. 
          Only when it comes together when you're in demo mode is there an over-the-shoulder 
          relationship. The programmers especially have to spend a lot of time 
          quietly ticky-tacking away on their own. None of the rest of us can 
          really read what they're writing, and once they have in mind what they're 
          trying to do, we're pretty much in the way. A little gesture gets accomplished, 
          we all gather and admire and critique it and then we separate again. 
          Creative programmers are the key players on any Cave Writing project 
          team. There's really not much comparison here in theater or film. They 
          are genuine co-authors. There's a growing rapport between computer programmers 
          and all the other art forms, but it's especially closely felt between 
          text writers and code writers: we both spend a lot of time at keyboards 
          trying to make artful things happen, and in the Cave we very much need 
          each other. </p>

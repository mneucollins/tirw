        <p><b>JW: Leading this workshop, you've taken a hands-on role on the projects?</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> It's exploratory collaborative work, and I'd say the role 
          I've played has been something like producer/director. The pieces are 
          workshopped as in all writing workshops, and I play the usual directorial 
          role of critiquing and advancing the projects, but I also have to watch 
          budgets and manage expectations. Anything is possible in there, but 
          not everything is practical or affordable. These are teams of students, 
          not professionals, so it is a learning experience for all of us, including 
          our young programmers. We pay for coding and some modeling and sound 
          engineering, so we have to estimate in advance the amount of hours required. 
          A pro might get something accomplished in one expensive hour that our 
          relatively inexperienced programmers need four or five less expensive 
          hours to do, learning as they go. Moreover, given the need for the graphic 
          servers to read the trackers and continually reload the stereo images 
          of any given project at a terrific speed, there is a significant memory 
          limitation. Finely pixilated intricate models can eat up a lot of memory 
          and make things pretty stuttery in there.</p>
        <p><b>SR: It sounds like it's important to have all the collaborators 
          actually working together in the Cave. I could see that being a problem, 
          where a writer comes into the space with a great idea but no realistic 
          notion of how to implement it.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> Designers too, because most young artists, like most young 
          writers, have not actually attempted any hard coding or modeled anything 
          in 3D, so they often underestimate the work involved, work that has 
          to be paid for on a very limited budget. There's the desire, for example, 
          to bring realistic-looking people into an interactive story or poem. 
          But each one of those models, if articulated and individualized, would 
          take an enormous amount of time to build and then get into motion, and 
          then they would not likely work all that well anyway, in part because 
          of the memory limitations of the ceaselessly reloading graphics server. 
          Maybe ten years down the road, one will be able to keep a whole stable 
          of virtual actors in a file folder, and you'll be able to select from 
          the model-base as you would actors from a casting agency, then layer 
          on eccentricities and costume them with a mouseclick and send them out 
          to play in multitudes, but right now everything has to be built, element 
          by element, from the ground up within the strict limitations of the 
          servers. So I encourage people to try to keep things relatively simple, 
          using texture mapping instead of intricate modeling where possible, 
          achieving their effects by means other than the attempted imitation 
          of the real world, using their own imaginations to challenge and stimulate 
          the imaginations of others. Thus, the forest that comes out of the night 
          sky and surrounds you in <i>This Is Just a Place</i>, which you've just 
          seen, is merely a texture-mapped cube, but there's a seeming depth to 
          the photo imagery, you hear the sounds of crickets and perhaps the faint 
          fall of rain as it breaks around you, and it feels convincing enough 
          to express a forest, even if it doesn't deliver it tree by tree. If 
          we'd spent a year or two modeling a whole forest, it likely would not 
          have felt that much more forestlike than the existing version.</p>
        <p><b>SR: So maybe it's not mimesis that you're after anyway.</b></p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> It isn't, absolutely not. Virtual reality is in reality 
          virtual artificiality. In fact that's one of its principal charms. In 
          a way, the more realistic it gets in there, the less interesting it 
          is.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> The Cave was built as a scientific visualization facility, 
          so the stuff that has been modeled in there is nothing that you have 
          traditional visual experience with: proteins, subatomic particles, the 
          surface of Mars, or some ancient temple -- these are things that you've 
          never seen before. You have no context, so you don't have that jarring 
          impact -- you don't mind if your model of snake venom protein resembles 
          a blob of soap bubbles. But when you're trying to do something like 
          a workshop story, to represent everyday life and objects, you have so 
          much familiarity with them that you can't do it in the traditional way 
          that it would be done in the Cave.</p>
        <p><b>RC:</b> That's a good point. A conventional fiction workshop story 
          is not the kind of thing that works well in there. Of course, it's my 
          feeling that conventional fiction workshop stories don't work all that 
          well in fiction workshops either. But this is a wondrous imaginative 
          interactive space where marvels can happen and the imagination can be 
          turned loose all around you. Abstraction works well in there, especially 
          in virtual deep space. Metaphoric and symbolic suggestion do. Theatrical 
          material -- it is a kind of stage, after all: you bring your elements 
          on stage and interact with them, immersing yourself in your own drama, 
          your own story.</p>
        <p>As for the seeming real, I've been convinced from the first time we 
          put anything up in there that what reality one is likely to achieve 
          in virtual reality can best be delivered by sound. Sound expands the 
          space vastly; it can move into the Cave and leave it, can be attached 
          to and enrich an object or a portion of the space, as you, as user, 
          transport yourself past or through it. In that party scene, for example, 
          you hear people talking both in the space you momentarily occupy and 
          beyond it in the ambient party chatter. It is a sound story in the making 
          and though the persons speaking are not visible, even as simple 2D models, 
          they seem to be more there than the beautifully elaborate but make-believe 
          model of the flat itself. <a href="part2-2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        <p>Push aside the thick, dark curtain, step across the cables on the floor 
          and you'll find yourself standing on a white floor with white screens 
          in front of you and to each of your sides. Above you are projectors 
          and speakers. You're given a pair of goggles and a glove. You put them 
          on and wait for <i>Screen</i> to begin. The space darkens. A voice begins 
          to read: &quot;In a world of illusions, we hold ourselves in place by 
          memories.&quot; In the dark there is nothing for you to do but listen. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Screen </i>is a literary work that can only be experienced in a 
          Cave. In a Cave, images -- or in the case of <i>Screen</i>, words -- 
          are projected on all three walls and on the floor. When you stand in 
          the Cave wearing goggles, you experience the projected images as a three 
          dimensional space in which you can move around. The goggles and glove 
          allow the Cave to track your position, so you can control the environment 
          by moving your body and your hand.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>Light over the sill of an unshaded<br>
              bedroom window, into a woman's eyes.<br>
              She turns away, slips half back under sleep.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Words cover the three screens in the Cave and are read aloud as you 
          follow them with your eyes. Each wall's words describe a double moment 
          in time, a woman or a man remembering and feeling the memory slip away, 
          hidden by the present.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>She uncurls her arm,<br>
              reaches back to lay her hand across<br>
              his thigh, to welcome him home,<br>
              but touches only a ridge of sheet, <br>
              sun warmed, empty.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&quot;We hold ourselves in place by memories,&quot; the first voice 
          reads to you in the dark. These narrated memories refuse to stay still. 
          After the voices have read the text aloud the words start to peel off 
          the walls. You can try to catch them with your gloved hand, and for 
          a while you may succeed in forcing them back where they belong, but 
          before too long the words crash all around you. This experience in virtual 
          reality is very different from the Holodeck vision of total immersion 
          in a make-believe world. <i>Screen</i> does not attempt to replicate 
          a real-world environment, but instead immerses the user in a reflexive 
          literary representation, one in which words and narrative remain predominant.</p>
        <p><i>Screen</i> was created collaboratively by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Andrew 
          McClain, Shawn Greenlee, Robert Coover, and Josh Carroll. They developed 
          the piece in the <a href="http://www.cascv.brown.edu/cavewriting/workshop.html" target="_blank">Cave 
          Writing Workshop at Brown University</a>, which is led by Robert Coover. 
          In December we visited the Cave and were able to experience several 
          works created in the workshop, including <i>Screen</i>, as well as Vesper 
          Stockwell, Dmitri Lemmerman, et al's &quot;This is Just a Place,&quot; 
          an interpretation of a poem by A.R. Ammons; &quot;Hypertable;&quot; 
          and a work in progress, set in a local flat. After the Cave demo, we 
          spoke with Joshua Carroll, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, and Robert Coover. The 
          interview is divided into three sections: in the first we discuss the 
          specific experience of collaborating on <i>Screen</i> with Josh and 
          Noah, in the second Robert Coover discusses the Cave writing workshops 
          in the context of his experience teaching electronic writing at Brown, 
          and in the third we discuss <i>Screen</i> with Noah in the context of 
          his other work in electronic writing. </p>

        <p><b>Jill Walker: When did you start working on the project?</b></p>
        <p><b>Noah Wardrip-Fruin:</b> We started in Bob Coover's first Cave Writing 
          workshop, which was in Spring 2002. Bob was able to arrange access to 
          this facility that previously had only been used at Brown for various 
          kinds of scientific computing. We had assembled an interdisciplinary 
          group and Bob's idea was to start by trying out little ideas. So we 
          were trying out ideas like the cube with text inside, as you saw, just 
          tiny narrative moments. One of those narrative moments was words flocking 
          around each other. Another narrative moment was words peeling off a 
          wall. Both of these were created by an undergraduate named Andrew McClain. 
          Andrew was focused on computer science and theater, and in a way these 
          were small dramatic moments. But neither had any user interaction, and 
          neither had any meaningful text. So I met with Andrew and said, &quot;I'm 
          interested in writing some text for these, and in us developing them 
          into a coherent piece, with the swarming happening around the body, 
          and introducing tracking of the hand to enable hitting the words back 
          in place, or into different places.&quot; And then, working with Bob, 
          I began to develop texts that worked virtual experience, touch, and 
          memory. Shawn Greenlee joined the project and began creating the sound 
          environment. Then we all continued to talk about those themes, and about 
          those elements, and by the end of that first semester we had the initial 
          &quot;design document.&quot; But it wasn't until the next semester, 
          when Josh came aboard, that we got further -- producing the first complete 
          version of the project. Once that happened we were able to more fully 
          understand what we were getting at, and so we produced a significantly 
          different text (including Bob's introduction and epilogue, which I believe 
          are his first pieces of writing for electronic media), changed the behavior 
          of the walls and other elements, and, until a few days ago, continued 
          experimenting with the pacing until we developed the experience arc 
          the piece has now. </p>
        <p><b>Scott Rettberg: How was the work on <i>Screen</i> divided, and what 
          roles did you and the other people involved play? How did the collaboration 
          work?</b></p>
        <p><b>Joshua Carroll:</b> We never really explicitly divided the work. 
          Whoever was best adapted to doing what needed to be done did it. I was 
          best suited to programming, but when the team got together we would 
          discuss the concept at all levels and brainstorm new possibilities. 
          Everyone's basic ideas about the piece coalesced fairly quickly: its 
          overall arc of activity, its essential look and feel, but we constantly 
          debated the subtleties and the piece consequently continued and continues 
          to evolve. As for who did what -- that kind of 'just happened', there 
          was never an explicit declaration of who was going to be responsible 
          for what.</p>
        <p><b>NWF</b>: Of course there's also an inevitable division of labor. 
          If there was something Josh thought could be better about the text, 
          he didn't say &quot;Noah, I've got a new draft of the text.&quot; [Josh 
          laughs] He said, &quot;Noah, maybe you should try X or Y.&quot; If there 
          was something like the timing we were just working on, I didn't say, 
          &quot;Josh, you know, I went in and I threw away your old version of 
          the code and I put in the way I wanted the timing to work, tell me what 
          you think.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> When Professor Coover originally organized the workshop, 
          he assembled an equal numbers of writers, modelers, sound people, and 
          engineers; so it was by definition interdisciplinary, and that made 
          it an ideal environment for these sorts of discussions to happen. Everybody 
          had a discrete area of expertise which they could feel comfortable sharing, 
          and so no one really felt threatened in terms of sharing ideas and finding 
          areas to contribute. </p>
        <p><b>SR: It seems that text in the Cave is working against the grain 
          of its medium. Can you talk about the way <i>Screen</i> works against 
          our expectations?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> We had a visual art professor come here. <i>Screen</i> 
          started, he looked around, and he said, &quot;Why isn't this using the 
          medium?&quot; He literally got a chair and sat outside the Cave to watch. 
          And he acted almost put upon, I would say. Then the first word peeled 
          off the wall and he leapt from his chair like something had tipped it 
          over! I think we like that element of surprise, in both ways. There's 
          a shock that the Cave isn't being used to create some sort of artificial 
          landscape for you to fly over, but rather it's being used a box, and 
          it's being used as a box with text on the wall, instead of pictures. 
          And then we like the surprise when that is disrupted.</p>
        <p><b>JC:</b> We've talked at times about giving more cues to people about 
          what they're supposed to do when the words rip off the walls, or starting 
          <i>Screen</i> in 3-D, because people say if you're going to do a project 
          for the Cave it should be more richly 3-D from the outset. But we've 
          always ended up shelving those ideas, because they would completely 
          rob the piece of the surprising quality it has -- that sense of being 
          taken out of where you thought you were. <a href="part1-2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        page 1 </b></font> 
        <p><b>JW: Do you find people actually read what you write? That sounds 
          rude, doesn't it! It sounds terrible!</b></p>
        <p>NWF: It's not rude at all! Clearly, I'm not writing in spaces that 
          encourage the kinds of reading one gets from print readers. If that's 
          what we mean by <i>actually reading</i> then people don't do it with 
          what I write. But I think other kinds of reading are possible, and worth 
          exploring. Take a piece like <i>Talking Cure</i>. In that piece I was 
          writing for the textual space created by Camille Utterback's &quot;Written 
          Forms&quot; video processing technique. This technique posterizes a 
          live video image down to three colors -- and the dark, medium, and light 
          areas of video each reveal the corresponding parts of three different 
          full-screen texts. It looks like a normal full-screen text until someone 
          is in front of the camera -- in the reading space. Once there's a reader 
          the different texts are continually blending on the horizontal plane 
          -- so left-to-right reading will produce a collage -- and people often 
          read the text in more vertical color patches produced by the video image 
          (which means words from one text, but not in the usual line-based groupings). 
          For <i>Talking Cure</i> I wanted to write something about word pictures, 
          about the gaze, about the kinds of things that Camille's technique brings 
          up. I wanted to write something for that kind of reading, not for the 
          kind to which we're accustomed. So I was doing my composition in strange 
          ways -- running the text of all three screens parallel to each other, 
          line by line, in my text editor, so I could be creating the sorts of 
          blending and border opportunities I wanted. Also I tried to compose 
          with an eye toward what would happen in semi-vertical patches. It was 
          a challenge. But I think people read it, and often for longer, with 
          more surprise, and more intense interest in the possibilities of the 
          language there than I can imagine if I'd put it on even the nicest paper. 
          A couple of people have even slowly, methodically, used their hands 
          to scan across the whole field of the camera and read individual layers 
          in isolation -- but that's probably an artifact of paper reading. </p>
        <p><i>Screen</i>, on the other hand, actually does ask for some of that 
          traditional, paper-style reading. That's what's happening through the 
          whole first section of the piece -- we're projecting text in a traditional 
          paragraph shape onto the wall as though you aren't in a VR space. But 
          then the words start to peel loose, and the reading of individual words 
          as they peel, as they fly around, as you hit them with your hand, this 
          is a new type of reading. And then, peripherally, there's also the reading 
          of the alterations that are taking place in the wall text as words, 
          or parts of words, end up in different places than where they started.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Peripheral reading, that's a great concept. That's rather like 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, isn't it: things happen around the edges 
          of what the reader is focused on. Is that something you think about?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes. Text has to be different to live in the electronic 
          environment, and I think being peripherally situated in relation to 
          some &quot;primary&quot; information-work task is a textual situation 
          to which I'll probably return. I think <i>The Impermanence Agent's</i> 
          relation to web browsing worked well. But this is not to say that I'm 
          not interested in the physical environment. I could imagine putting 
          text on walls, or in other parts of the physical environment. And I 
          have been thinking about a piece that would end up on that classic physical 
          medium, paper, probably in the form of a map. But to return to your 
          question, yes, I'm interested in things that are experienced peripherally, 
          and I'm interested in things that you play indirectly. People do play 
          <i>The Impermanence Agent</i>, but they play it much more indirectly 
          than they play <i>Talking Cure</i>. </p>
        <p><b>JW: A lot of people talk about the network and about its being electronic, 
          but this point about its being peripheral is less emphasized. It's something 
          a lot of people have been anxious about, you know, the lack of attention, 
          and here you're saying that that's what you're aiming at.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> There are things on my computer that I pay the old-fashioned 
          attention to -- for example, when I'm reading a news story in my Web 
          browser, I pay attention to it once and then it's gone. But the things 
          that are on my screen, perhaps covered by other things, or partially 
          obscured, or over in a corner, the things that are there for a long 
          time are the things that really inhabit my electronic environment and 
          are specific to it, rather than just an importing.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Your latest works, <i>Talking Cure</i> and <i>Screen</i>, are 
          very much installation works in a physical space that you can't take 
          home.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> If there's any thread that runs through everything I've 
          done -- and you could argue with me and say &quot;you know, there isn't,&quot; 
          but if there is -- it is that I'm trying to be specific to and investigate 
          whatever medium I work with. <i>The Impermanence Agent </i>is about 
          browser specific, Web specific artwork. The Cave is the specific space 
          for <i>Screen</i>. No, <i>Screen</i> is not part of your day-to-day 
          information life at all. It really is a place where you go and pay that 
          old-fashioned kind of attention.</p>
        <p><b>SR: How was working with print writers in the MFA workshop at Brown? 
          Were you writing for print, writing print for works that would become 
          electronic, or presenting electronic work to writers who worked only 
          in print?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, when I was an undergrad, I went and spent a month 
          at Irvine. I was working with a writer there, and one of the things 
          I did was hang around the MFA workshops. There were interesting people 
          there, certainly, but it seemed to me that, at that moment, what they 
          were trying to do was very similar. They were all trying to write a 
          certain kind of literary fiction and get an advance for it. It became 
          clear as I got more and more involved in electronic writing that it 
          wouldn't be pursuable in a program like that. Brown is a program for 
          freaks and misfits. In the first fiction writing workshop that I took 
          at Brown, I was the only person who was writing in a computational form, 
          but another writer turned in an audio tape, and everyone got a copy 
          of the audio tape and everyone listened to it and we critiqued it -- 
          that was his fiction practice. A different person turned something in 
          that was on videotape. Many people turned things in that were collage 
          oriented, really trying to explore the space of paper, and some of those 
          were irreproducible. So I didn't feel out of place at all in the MFA 
          program. Also there was very little emphasis on traditional publication. 
          Students who expressed interest in immediate publication in fact might 
          get told by the faculty &quot;I hope that you won't take the time that 
          we're paying you to be here to write a bunch of letters to publishers 
          or agents, I hope you'll use it to explore work that you wouldn't be 
          able to explore if you had to have another job, or if you felt pressured 
          to get published. I hope you'll use this time to do strange work you'd 
          never do otherwise and find out whether there's some other place for 
          you to go, rather than pursuing what you already know.&quot; So in an 
          environment like that, electronic writing was the weird misfit activity 
          I was up to, and it was no different from the weird misfit activities 
          other people were doing or are being encouraged to find and try. Also, 
          Brown's long history in electronic writing and interdisciplinary collaboration 
          gives some indication of the environment. After all, Ted Nelson and 
          Andy van Dam created a hypertext system at Brown in the 1960s, when 
          computers were still basically seen as number crunchers. And Bob and 
          others have been doing electronic writing workshops and research projects 
          at Brown through the writing program, continually, for nearly 15 years.</p>
        <p>Which is an answer to only part of your question. The answer to the 
          other part of your question is -- because of that encouragement, because 
          of that model, I viewed being in a workshop with someone like Carole 
          Maso as an opportunity to encounter her as an artist and teacher. My 
          electronic work was happening somewhere else. She would say &quot;I 
          want you to write something that has the structure of a symphony, and 
          I want you to figure out what you're going to mean by the structure 
          of a symphony, because <i>you're</i> going to have to mean it.&quot; 
          So we each went and did our different research about what we thought 
          a symphonic structure and fiction writing might have that could connect 
          them. Nobody was doing something that was meant for print or non-print 
          publication, we were just exploring the idea of a symphony. Some of 
          the things that came out of those experiences did end up connecting 
          with my electronic writing. An exercise in Carole's class produced a 
          sentence that was the beginning of the first draft of the text that 
          became <i>Screen</i>.</p>
        <p align="center">1 | 2 </p>
        <p><b>JW: I wanted to ask a bit about collaboration, which we did touch 
          upon before. I think you've collaborated on all your electronic writing 
          projects? Maybe not <i>The Book of Endings</i>?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Yes, everything since <i>The Book of Endings</i> has been 
          a collaborative project.</p>
        <p><b>JW: Why?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> First, let me say that I think almost every new media art 
          project is collaborative, and it's often more of a question of how much 
          that is acknowledged or foregrounded or treated as a strength rather 
          than an unfortunate necessity. A project may have been worked on by 
          three people or five people or an entire laboratory, but it can end 
          up credited to one person who brought in the funding or is the most 
          famous or thinks they had the idea. I think, increasingly, we're going 
          to see our field become like theater or film. There will be a very small 
          number of people who write their own script, are their own dramaturge, 
          are the only actor, are the lighting designer, and so on. There are 
          people who do that in theatre and film and there are going to be people 
          who do that in electronic art. But for the most part it's going to be 
          people who are coming at the project from different directions, sharing 
          their thoughts, coming to decisions by various more or less hierarchical 
          means about what will end up in the piece, and then making it happen 
          together. My work has been collaborative because I have wanted to do 
          projects that were going to be better as collaborations than they would 
          have been if I did them on my own, and because I've found people I've 
          wanted to collaborate with, and because I've felt that interdisciplinary 
          collaboration was an important, exciting direction for electronic writing. 
        </p>
        <p><b>JW: Your work is more based on concepts and physical objects than 
          any other electronic literature I can think of, at the same time as 
          the words are very meaningful and present. Do you care whether this 
          is called art or literature? What are your thoughts about that relationship?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> At least at the moment, I think we find a lot of electronic 
          writing is better accepted in the art community than in the writing 
          community. In the art community however it's sometimes seen as being 
          &quot;that really wordy electronic art that takes a long time to consume.&quot; 
          As though John Cayley's work is somehow belabored Jenny Holzer. Nonetheless, 
          I think it is good that there is an interdisciplinary view of new media 
          art that includes writing, and I think it is good that people are doing 
          electronic writing that engages well with the art community. In the 
          long term there's also the disciplinary background that work like mine 
          is coming from, work like Talan Memmott's is coming from, which is important 
          to the work. I say this even though Talan has been a painter and I've 
          worked in a computer science lab. I say this because we've also both 
          been writers and readers. And to repeat something else I've said before: 
          I think the problem might be that electronic art can be in the Whitney, 
          whereas electronic writing can't get a publishing contract from Knopf. 
          So it will be a longer time before the traditional parts of the community 
          accept the electronic work, because it can't occupy the place of pride 
          the rest of the community wants their work to be in. They won't say, 
          &quot;Hey, that got into the place where I wish my work was!&quot; But 
          eventually writing goes where people read, and people don't just read 
          paper any more. Maybe people already don't primarily read paper.</p>
        <p><b>SR: After your experience of teaching at Brown, do you think that 
          teaching electronic writing is the kind of academic job you'd like to 
          have?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> You know, both my parents were academics, and the first 
          real job I had was working at a university. I think that I would probably 
          rather do electronic writing workshops with bright, enthusiastic students, 
          like those I taught at Brown, than most any kind of work. But I know 
          not every teaching situation is as rewarding, and I think I would probably 
          rather be a research scientist like I was at NYU, or maybe any number 
          of other things, than put my energy into teaching people who don't care. 
        </p>
        <p><b>SR: What kinds of assignments did you give your e-writing students 
          when you taught at Brown? Did your students mostly write for the Web, 
          or did you do installation things?</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Let's see, there were many different things the students 
          did. One of the student projects I enjoyed was a text that appeared 
          to be an installer script. You ran the program from your command line. 
          He and another student in the class got it running on a number of UNIX 
          variants, which means you can run it on Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and 
          so on. You type something into the command line, and it says &quot;I'm 
          unpacking this, I'm installing that, I'm looking for this,&quot; and 
          then it does the typical thing of throwing up impossible to interpret 
          errors, and then it waits. It does something else and waits. Then it 
          starts being self-reflexive and funny, and telling little stories. Another 
          student created a story in a Yahoo! Mail account. There were messages 
          received by a character in the inbox, the character's responses in the 
          outbox -- but also texts nestled in other places, in the box for unsent 
          drafts, in the filenames of attachments, on items pictured in the attachments 
          themselves. We also used blogs in the class, and some people wrote things 
          that were specific to their blogs. In some ways they were an entry, 
          but in other ways they were playing with the form of an entry to be 
          a writing assignment. There were projects that didn't necessarily have 
          to have an electronic form but that were about thinking through things 
          that are related to electronic media. For example, everyone had to go 
          out and find a game. We did playtesting of the games. Then they had 
          to take the interaction structure of the game and alter it in a way 
          that was appropriate to some particular kind of textual production. 
          They had to talk about the text, and about the change in the game, and 
          then we tried to evaluate the changes in the structure along with the 
          text that was supposed to accompany them. There was no digital implementation 
          of that at all, that was all done on paper. All of which is not to say 
          that people didn't also do things like Flash projects for the class.</p>
        <p><b>SR: I think that's a wrap.</b></p>
        <p><b>JW: Except that we didn't mention Ted Nelson.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> Well, I could talk about my electronic writing definition, 
          and sneak in a mention of Nelson's name.</p>
        <p><b>SR: Yeah, why don't you do that real quick? But make it three minutes 
          or less.</b></p>
        <p><b>NWF:</b> [laughs] Well, I've been traveling and talking quite a 
          bit, and people ask me what I do. So I say that I work in new media, 
          and that what I mean by new media is &quot;computation used as an expressive 
          medium.&quot; This is what Nick Montfort and I came to when we were 
          working on<i> The New Media Reader</i>. Just as film can be used for 
          data storage (like microfilm) or it can be used as an expressive medium, 
          so the computer can be used for something else (like number crunching) 
          <i>or</i> it can be used as an expressive medium. And I think there's 
          a subtype of new media -- new media as approached by writers -- that 
          I am calling &quot;electronic writing.&quot; My other way of putting 
          that, of defining electronic writing, has been: &quot;writing that requires 
          computation at the time of reading.&quot; At first I ran into controversy 
          involving the term hypertext (and yes, I have a rant about people who 
          use this term without reading Ted Nelson's work), or things like that. 
          But more recently I've had discussions -- and this week, Jill, you witnessed 
          a heated one -- in which people have said, &quot;This is unfair. You're 
          drawing the lines of your club to leave out people who do things like 
          print writing that is generated by a computer program. Those people 
          are deeply addressing computation. They are deeply engaged with digital 
          culture and digital media -- it's just that their work ends up on paper. 
          So your definition is just as exclusionary as many of these other definitions 
          I've heard, which do things like include hypertext but exclude interactive 
          fiction.&quot; I think that's funny, because nobody would say that if 
          our topic were educational materials. They wouldn't say that it's unfair 
          to differentiate and say that you're talking about new media materials, 
          leaving out all materials that are on paper, even though some of them 
          were created using computers that calculated statistical models of the 
          contents. And yet I think that on some level those who object to what 
          I'm saying have a point, it's true that this category may at times be 
          too narrow for the conversation we want to have, and so we also need 
          to think about larger categories -- &quot;digital literature,&quot; 
          for instance, which Roberto Simanowski talks about. He's providing a 
          much bigger tent. Maybe we always need to reference that bigger tent, 
          even when our topic is a more focused one. But I am also unshaken in 
          my belief that just as people in the visual arts, or people who are 
          in music, have types of new media that they identify as coming out of 
          their disciplines, we as writers should embrace electronic writing as 
          new media growing out of our discipline and history -- and we should 
          be proud of it, not berating ourselves for drawing too narrow a boundary, 
          or concerned that its breadth includes writers of web pages, computer 
          games, email narratives, installation artworks, and much more. We can 
          see that text -- along with rules for sequencing, altering, and collaging 
          text -- is increasingly being created for computational media. We can 
          see that reading text -- and hearing text performed, by human or computational 
          voices -- is increasingly happening through a computer that's doing 
          more than just playback. Writing is happening for computational contexts 
          that enable interaction, communication, and transformation. It's our 
          chance to discover written language anew. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"><br>

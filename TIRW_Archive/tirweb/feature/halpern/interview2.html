          <p><b>PW:</b> Since this is a narrative of salvation, I'm wondering 
            how you struck a balance between salvaging &quot;artifacts&quot; to 
            provoke a narrative and allowing the user to decide what this narrative 
            will be. <br>
            <br>
            <b>TH:</b> In selecting 'artifacts', two principles guided my decisions. 
            First, I was looking to explore issues of re-mediation and transmission 
            or, in other words, the process by which older forms of representation 
            like a photograph, travelogue, or archival film clip circulate, accrue 
            new meanings, and recombine to generate new forms. Second, I wanted 
            to explore how different media forms interact to produce a broader 
            field of perceptual possibilities delimiting what can be said and 
            seen within a given historical moment. </p>
<p>In this respect, I was thinking about the production of 'artifacts' more in terms of defining the contours of what could be said and seen in my project than as concrete 'artifacts'. I saw myself as looking to advance a grammar of representation more than producing a singular statement of expression. This logic led me to work backwards or in software development terms to take a 'top down' approach. This approach entails: first, defining a series of general principles that determine the ontological status and autonomy of different 'content' elements, second, working from these principles to produce a system (narrative apparatus), and third, producing the different 'content' elements ('artifacts'). </p>
<p>In short, I tried to strike a balance between the concrete 'artifacts' and abstract user-defined space through recourse to a grammatical or systematic approach to developing my project, advancing from the general to the particular.</p>
          <p><b>PW:</b> The pun on &quot;desktop&quot; seems to organize these 
            artifacts. The image of the desktop in the office, like the &quot;desktop&quot; 
            of my computer, provides a tool for information retrieval. While The 
            Case Collection supposedly &quot;exploits popular forms of information 
            culture&quot;, puns, such as &quot;desktop&quot; also critique of 
            these forms by linking them with a colonial mindset. </p>
          <p><b>TH</b>: I think you are right to identify a tension or ambivalence 
            here. I'm clearly interested in both the progressive and regressive 
            impulses of computational media. I think the emergence of technologies 
            of mechanical reproduction, part and parcel, with the colonial project 
            birthed a fantasy of desire and difference that defined the limits 
            of representation. Travelogues, colonial photographs, and naturalist's 
            maps all corroborated in the production of a set of perceptual possibilities, 
            dictating what must be represented, what cannot be represented, and 
            what exceeds representation. </p>
<p>In noting this, however, I do not mean to trace a direct lineage from colonial mapping practices to a computer-mapping interface or your personal &quot;DESKTOP&quot;. Nor do I think that a computer &quot;DESKTOP&quot; is merely a representation of a terrain, an early 21st century  variant of the colonial map. Clearly, it is also a tool for accessing, modifying, and organizing the memory on your personal computer's hard drive, a task that the colonial map never set out to do. What I am attempting to do with the Case Collection is something far more ambiguous. I am trying to explore what different organizations of the perceptual field achieve and how computational media both draws upon and reorients previous perceptual practices. I'm looking to account for the distance traveled between the colonial map and the computer interface. As images, texts, videos, and computer games converge in today's networked multimedia environments, I'm trying to provoke users to think about how the violent heritages of different media forms like the novel or cinema assemble and reassemble to produce new possibilities for perception and new grammars of meaning making.</p>
          <p><b>PW</b>: Since this does involve a process of re-mediation, how 
            did you decide on format? To be more specific, as I was viewing the 
            children's book, I almost unconsciously submit the pictures to film 
            analysis. Likewise, in the diaries, the user is allowed to see the 
            handwriting of the diaries themselves, yet typed script transcribes 
            the handwriting. In a project such as The Collection, how did you 
            negotiate between the direct simulation of the medium and a rupturing 
            of mediums?</p>
          <p><b>TH</b>: I'm not entirely certain I can account for my process 
            of negotiation. What I can say is that I'm preoccupied with questions 
            of attention and temporality. In this respect, I often find myself 
            drawing on my background as an interface designer. I'm interested 
            in maximizing screen real estate, but not to saturate the user, bombard 
            him or her with messages, but to create focus areas that will move 
            the eye from one frame to another. This is why I presented the Diaries 
            in the format I did. I wanted the aesthetics and movement of the handwriting 
            or page turning to incite the eye to read the type. I wanted different 
            formats to serve as frames and focus areas, which could then be compared 
            to promote further reading and narration. At the same time, my approach 
            to negotiating different media formats makes woefully clear that regardless 
            of form or focus, I endow the computer screen with meaning, its real-estate 
            serves as the over arching arbitrator of perception.</p>
<p>There are elements of the Rhino's Tale that lend themselves to a cinematic analysis, although I would caution against seeing the Tale as essentially cinematic.  Indeed, there are a good many ways in which I would hope The Rhino's Tale resists narrative cinema, or at the very least, provokes a rethinking of dominant understandings of cinematic perception and the construction of cinematic time.  </p>
<p>For example, I feel sound is often assumed to complement the flow of images in narrative cinema. The dialogues, background noise, and musical score all contribute to the general production of an experience of the narrative's thrust forward and a coherent environment in which the spectator is drawn in and immersed. This is not the Case in the Rhino's Tale. There is no sound; animations and text serve as the raw resources from which the Tale unfolds. In presenting the Tale, I was more interested in producing an experience of autonomous elements, and making the integration of different elements a problem, one that must be thought and constructed in order to experience the work.  This is why the animations in the Rhino's tale supplement the text below them in an almost Derridaian fashion.  </p>
          <p>They attempt to dramatize a series of textual exclusions, and in 
            so doing, present the possibility of driving meaning in new directions. 
            The animations are as much complementary of each other and the text 
            below them, as they are antagonistic. Likewise, I footnoted the text 
            so that users might be catapulted out to other sources of knowledge, 
            other types of texts. I think this strategy is probably more in keeping 
            with dominant understandings of Web based media then narrative cinema, 
            with its well-documented history of containment. Regardless, cinematic 
            grammars informed the choices I made with the Tale and I imagine provide 
            users with a point of reference from which to understand the piece.

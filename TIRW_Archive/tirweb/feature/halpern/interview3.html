          <p><b>PW</b>: Noticing such things as the absence of Arloz from the 
            frame in most of the third chapter, and the use of extreme close-up 
            POV shots from the rhino's perspective, the visual story seems to 
            narrate a sort of becoming, a shift in identity as Arloz learns language, 
            and likewise a de-centering of the reader-subject. </p>
          <p><b>TH</b>: I am operating with a concept of de-centering here or at the very 
            least unfolding. The introduction and accrual of new information constantly 
            creates a demand to reconstruct the user's mode of apprehension or, 
            in other words, her/his position vis-&#136;-vis the text and its temporal 
            unfolding. I think its fair to say that the very transformation in 
            POV becomes an engine of the narrative. </p>
          <p><b>PW</b>: . . . and yet The Rhino's Tale seems rather ambivalent 
            toward the potential for this becoming to transcend the politics of 
            representation. On the other hand, this is a self-reflexive tale, 
            which seems to relate the act of reading to a metamorphosis. </p>

          <p><b>TH</b>: Yes. The Rhino's Tale is obsessed with remediation, transformation 
            and becoming. True to the language of digital media in which it unfolds, 
            it is chalk full of loops, morphs, and repetitions. (Might I draw 
            your attention here to the caption in which a woman's hand spreads 
            jam on a slice of bread in a continuous loop in Chapter 3 or the repetitive 
            appearance of butterflies throughout Chapter 2) In identifying these 
            moments, however, I would like to suggest that metamorphosis is a 
            central strategy of narration. </p>
          <p>The Rhino's Tale encourages users to point and click, and to search 
            out ways of accruing more information so as to fill in the ostensible 
            gaps between different visual and textual registers. For example, 
            the presence of butterflies in the visual narrative becomes a cause 
            for association of the Rhino's Tale with other artifacts in the Case 
            Collection. Integrating the users/reader into a sort of pattern of 
            textual reading becomes a problem, a central preoccupation of the 
            Tale. As the user becomes adept at following the story, pointing and 
            clicking, and integrating different information streams and aesthetic 
            strategies a reading practice develops. I would hope this reading 
            practice comes to be seen as one that rests as much on concepts of 
            metamorphosis and supplementation as cinematic codes of time's forward 
            thrust.</p>
          <p><b>PW</b>: You comment elsewhere on the sort of rigidity associated 
            with cinema. Am I correct in assuming that you see loops and morphs 
            themselves as breaks from the linearity of the cinematic timeline?<br>
  <br>
            <b>TH</b>: Yes and no. From a historical perspective, I can tell you 
            that the idea of loop was not born with computational media. At the 
            turn of the last century, motion picture technologies were often shown 
            in loops to their audiences. Indeed, older terminology borrowed from 
            cinema has often served as a guidepost on the road to the development 
            of multimedia, igniting a series of attempts to produce new modes 
            of perception. I, therefore, think my comments about cinema must be 
            situated in this context since cinematic time only appears rigid retrospectively. 
            Who's to say how my present efforts to capture and produce time will 
            withstand time? Perhaps they will appear just as rigid as cinematic 
            time in the near future...</p>
          <p> <b>PW</b>: In The Rhino's Tale, specific forms of mediation, (moving 
            image supplementing text) don't represent a metamorphosis. Instead 
            representation is a process of metamorphosis.</p>
          <p><b>TH</b>: Sure. What is at stake is the very process of representation. 
            I wonder if this is not a question that seems to emerge at specific 
            historical moments like the present one in which new conditions throw 
            into sharp relief older concepts surrounding representation, its limits, 
            and imperatives. In such a climate, it is not hard to understand how 
            a direct concern for the process of representation can mobilize familiar 
            relationships like inside/outside, self/other, and content/form for 
            radically new and ambiguous agendas.</p>
          <p><b>PW</b>: The two diaries have probably been the artifacts that 
            have intrigued me the most. The language of The Black Diary seems 
            invested in rupture; the narrative constantly suggests human bodies 
            penetrating each other, images of the setting blending with the body 
            of the subject, and various illusions to exhalation and inhalation. 
            On the other hand the white diary appears to incorporate the very 
            rhetoric of colonialism. What is unique for me, is that neither the 
            more fluid representation in the black diary, nor the more striated 
            representation of the white diary seems to overcome the politics of 
            representation. Could you comment on how you constructed both the 
            narrative and rhetorical styles of both diaries.<br>
  <br>
            <b>TH</b>: I think you're right to point to the failures of the Black 
            and White Diaries and to note that neither dairy overcomes the politics 
            of representation. In my defense, I can attest that it was never my 
            aim to overcome representation -a far too ambitious mandate for the 
            space of one work. Indeed, I wonder if indeed it is at all possible, 
            or at least worthwhile, to commit to such a project. </p>
          <p>The Black and White Diaries attest to my on-going interest in forms. Both texts 
            reflect too much time spent reading explorers journals, colonial novels, 
            psychoanalytic case studies, and Edwardian era history books even 
            if they are not exact replicas of any one of these earlier media forms. 
            In producing the diaries, I was interested in transmitting experiences 
            and concepts that these earlier forms put into representation, produced 
            as symptoms and visible signs of discourse, and in so doing gesturing 
            to new perceptual possibilities. I wrote the Black and White texts 
            simultaneously, thinking of them as operating within a broader field 
            of forms. I wanted readers to be able to recognize them as autonomous 
            works, but I wanted this autonomy to be haphazard, fragile. In a certain 
            sense, I wanted the autonomy to be predicated on the Diary's relationship 
            to other 'artifacts' in the collection. The White Diary, then, can 
            be said to provide the codes for the interpretation of the Black Diary; 
            it casts the Black Diary as a work of literature, a register of desire, 
            one which blurs the boundaries between depraved acts, new experiences 
            of time and space, and dreams. Alternatively, the Black Diary frames 
            the White Diary as authoritative, documentary, official. Together 
            they corroborate in the production of a set of perceptual possibilities, 
            an experience of time and space mitigated by forms that are intelligible 
            only retrospectively through the terms of the archive. </p>
          <p><b>PW:</b> So, though neither diary is exempt from embodiment, within 
            the variation between diaries there seems to be a sort of liberating 
            play of subjectivities. A flood if you will.<br>
            <br>
            <b>TH:</b> Two points here. I'm glad you made this association since 
            my use of flood in the Collection is similar to my explicit focus 
            on change and metamorphosis in the Rhino's Tale. In both cases, I'm 
            interested in exploring and extending the particular possibilities 
            presented by different media forms to structure and advance a sense 
            of time. Moreover, I'm interested in exploring the relationship between 
            different structures of time and the production and maintenance of 
            a point of view or subject position. In the Rhino's Tale, time became 
            a problem for me, but one that had to be thought not solely in terms 
            of representation but also in terms of functionality, a point that 
            I will try and expand on in relation to the aspects of the Collection 
            shortly. At the same time, I think I'm quite clear through my transformation 
            of POV, through my explicit use of different colors, and through my 
            inclusion and exclusion of detail in the different Chapters that I'm 
            looking to ask-- what would it mean to produce a narrative time which 
            seeks to capture, structure, and delimit concepts of dynamism, change, 
            and morphing and not strictly movement forward along a timeline?</p>
          <p>Second, the idea of subjectivity is also subject to the same duress 
            as the concept of time. While in many respects it maintains many of 
            its ontological trappings, my construction of the Rhino's Tale seeks 
            to temper purely ontological concerns surrounding subjectivity and 
            its liberation or oppression. What I'm essentially trying to say here 
            is that my orientation to the production of subjectivity in the Case 
            Collection is primarily functionalist. As I designed the different 
            'artifacts' I continued to ask myself 'how will users get from point 
            A to point B? How will they be able to interface with each 'artifact?' 
            In light of these questions, I came to think of subjectivity as an 
            assignment, a role that readers and writers could take up in order 
            to navigate an emerging information space. <a href="interview4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

          <p><b>PW:</b> Sir Francis Case seems to be a major force of subjectivity 
            in the work, but a uniquely de-centered subject. Could you talk a 
            little about how you developed the character of Sir Francis Case? 
            He seems to be a locus for the ambivalence of representation. While 
            his collections of butterfly specimens seem to enforce a very colonial 
            attitude, the fractured voice of the two diaries resists this colonial 
            attitude.<br>
            <br>
            <b>TH:</b> Case is important to the Collection, not so much as a figure 
            before or outside language that must be represented and expressed, 
            but as a locus of discourse. In this manner, Case is more a series 
            of narrative strategies then a character or consolidated subject. 
            He presented me with a means of asking questions. What are the possible 
            relationships between different media forms? How can media forms reflect 
            and advance different forms of experience and concretize and literalize 
            perceptual positions? Indeed, the ruptures and splits in Case's personality 
            must be seen as perceptual possibilities made available through the 
            archive. This is why I tried to develop Case's character through the 
            production of different perceptual possibilities and different relationships 
            between 'artifacts' and not through a turn inwards into a narrative 
            of confession, as one might be lead to expect when first presented 
            with the Diaries for example. </p>
          <p><b>PW :</b> How does mapping, temporality and dynamism function in your 
            peice. The Case Collection seems to consist of bodies, encasements 
            of bodies, and maps of both spatial and temporal territories, yet 
            the interface allows the user to map these preexisting maps, creating 
            a sort of temporal play between geometric relationships.</p>
          <p><b>TH:</b> The map is important to my work since I began with mapping. 
            I wanted to cover a terrain, but as is so often the case, the map 
            exceeded the terrain. It became an interface, a way of calling new 
            things into being, engaging with newly imagined social worlds. It 
            made me less concerned with representing an external out there and 
            more with producing something new on screen.. My earlier work was 
            much simpler, in part, due to the conditions I was responding to (I 
            was commissioned to create the work for a project on ethics and science) 
            but in setting out to map a terrain, I learned that I was more interested 
            in creating one. Most of my projects are failures in one way or another. 
            They set out to do one thing and then in the process lead me somewhere 
            else. I hope these failures are productive. Sometimes they are, sometimes 
            they aren't. In any case, I'm aware that the experience of productive 
            failure, projects that never quite happen, is central to the historical 
            and philosophical trajectory of the computational media in which I 
            work...</p>
          <p><b>PW:</b> In one of your earlier projects, Chromosome 22, you also incorporate 
            the mapping function. How did this earlier piece comment on The Case 
            Collection?</p>
          <p><b>TH:</b> Chromosome 22 was a much earlier work and one that barely scratched 
            the surface of the issues I explore in the Case Collection. It was 
            commissioned for a project on science and ethics, so I don't feel 
            I was as free to conceptualize the piece as I would have liked too, 
            and yet you're right to point out that many of my interests are reflected 
            in the work, my concern for maps delimiting and producing a terrain, 
            an information space, and my desire to explore the history and construction 
            of knowledge.</p>
<p>My emphasis on mapping, in the earlier work, was a response to what I saw as an increasingly difficult information space surrounding the public discourse around biology that needed to be navigated, organized and re-conceptualized. At the same time, I saw myself relating the idea of the map to the interface, an effort echoed in my attempts to relate the Colonial map to the Desktop interface in the Case Collection. In both cases, the distance between a map and an interface became increasingly hard to maintain. Both Chromosome 22 and the Case Collection present an ostensible map,  but in each case the maps are interfaces to storage systems that can be transformed through use. I think the unifying theme here, is a desire to open up and explore the ambiguities rife in mapping an information field. I think in both cases, I was more interested in exploring the perceptual imperatives shaping mapping practices, their transformation and spread and not with reaching a definitive conclusion about my chosen information fields.</p>
          <p><b>PW:</b> On a more personal note, could you describe your creative process 
            a bit?</p>          
          <p><b>TH:</b> My work process is often impulsive. I have ideas, fear 
            I will forget them and this breeds anxiety and a desire to act in 
            the here now... I turn to what I know and try to do things, Java, 
            HTML, Flash, pen, paper, word-processing.. Sometimes this works. More 
            often then not I get caught up and pulled into problems that, hours 
            later, I realize where insignificant, unrelated to my aims. While 
            I ascribe this process to my personality, I'm well aware that this 
            desire for instantaneity, this form of response is conditioned, a 
            natural outgrowth of too much time spent behind a computer screen......

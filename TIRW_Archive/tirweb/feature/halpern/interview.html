          <p>Arriving at the site for The Case Collection, you enter a dim corridor 
            of what appears to be either a library or a museum. &quot;The flood 
            threatened to destroy everything,&quot; the text explains as you're 
            carried through the corridor. You learn that not all was lost. The 
            flood rescued &quot;two diaries, an illustrated children's book, a 
            journalist's sound recording&quot; and other &quot;artifacts from 
            a naturalist's secret collection.&quot; Next you enter a study of 
            some sort, with papers, books and tiny figurines scattered across 
            a desktop. As you drag your cursor over the artifacts, clicking on 
            them to take a closer look and listen, stories begin to take shape, 
            connections are made, various voices echo from the almost erased history. 
            Footnotes, searching functions and maps recover the debris of story. 
            There was an explorer, a naturalist named Sir Francis Case, whose 
            exploits and mental state seem important, but why? His identity, fragmented 
            by both a vaguely described &quot;mental disorder&quot; and the tangential 
            nature of the artifacts themselves, lingers over each artifact like 
            a phantom.</p>
          <p>The Case Collection presents the debris of a colonialist narrative, 
            and invites you to explore, map and interpret this debris. Using new 
            media to comment on old mediums and signifying practices, the piece 
            presents a landscape of fragmented documentation. </p>
          <p>For the past few months I've been sifting through these artifacts, 
            playing the role of the archeologist, and maintaining a correspondence 
            with Tal Halpern, the creator of The Case Collection. What follows 
            is the result of this process of salvage and correspondence.</p>
          <p><br>
            <b>PATRICK WALTER:</b> I guess the best place to start is the beginning, 
            meaning the intro. In a sense, this short flash movie is the least 
            interactive part of the piece, yet it also seems to place the user's 
            interaction within a larger narrative. <br>
            <br>
            <b>TAL HALPERN:</b> While the 'introduction' may or may not be 'interactive', 
            it certainly serves as a contextualzing device. It points to other 
            'artifacts' and experiences in the Collection, and in so doing, seeks 
            to entice the user to explore further. In the 'introduction' as in 
            much of my work, I'm interesting exploiting the tension between linear 
            narrative and interactivity.<br>
          </p>
          <p><b>PW:</b> During the introduction, the flood becomes major part 
            of this &quot;orienting&quot; process, and reoccurs in the artifacts 
            themselves. The image of the flood seems to operate on at least two 
            different levels. <br>
            <br>
            <b>TH:</b> Yes, the very term &quot;flood&quot; serves as a keyword 
            by which different 'artifacts' are archived, organized, linked, and 
            made searchable. In this sense the flood operates as a taxonomic catagory 
            like any other. On the other hand, the flood is unique, a singular 
            event. It presents a semantically rich unit, a symbolic placeholder 
            in an unfolding sign system. In the Case Collection, floods constantly 
            raise the specter of total destruction, pure loss, the annihilation 
            of meaning. In the 'Archivist's Introduction', as you said, Patrick, 
            users are recruited to respond to the flood, to participate in a 'narrative 
            of salvation'. This act of recruitment is not as innocent as it might 
            seem. It harbors an imperative to recast the possibility of the contingent, 
            accidental and unwieldy in terms of its opposite-a desire for structure. 
            My use of flood imagery, then, can be thought in terms of certain 
            type of traumatic event, the type of trauma Freud describes as a shock 
            to the psyche, a shock that is unassimilable, its impact felt years 
            later when another accident renders its terms legible. This is why 
            the Case Collection is shot through with references to floods, to 
            repeated events, which shore up the residue of previous experience.</p>
          <p> For example, in the Diaries, overflowing rivers render genocide 
            visible in the human bodies washing ashore. Accident sets in motion 
            a whole chain of eventualities culminating in love, loss, life, death 
            and history. Time itself is subject to structure. I want to relate 
            this chain of eventuality specifically to digital media. For not only 
            is time a subject of literary language, but it is also central to 
            an architecture of data that tracks users, creates links, processes 
            queries and implements command lines on run-time. I don't think, however, 
            that there is a one to one correspondence between the literary languages 
            I use and the programming language I use. I do, however, want to suggest 
            that time is a preoccupation of all these different registers, a problem 
            that must be figured, represented, and literalized as experience at 
            the moment. <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

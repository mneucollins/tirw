A loss is less and more to do with how we do with less than when there were the more.  When there were more and then a less and it is more difficult and less easy.  Less that is a hole in more, and not expected.  The addition and subtraction of it, the less which goes to nothing.  Less as when a vacuum takes an aspect and as when it closes down and drops something.  Something more, or less.  The getting used to it is more but not an easy now as more and more is not the same as more was, or on and on and on, and is the harder then as of a never or a river going through it stopped.</p>
<p>He said that he would move into a silence.  Silence would not move but he would move and move himself into it, a move that he would do, an in.  And then a biggest hole inside the rest of us.  And looking into it from edge without a fence, ourselves a kind of silence, not an in, a watch of us and silent.  How he would say and move as if a silence were a house when after packing he would move but we would not, and then when we would look and we would not, also.</p>
<p>A bird would not do it, a dog or cat, delivery by bike, a call, a mew, a woof or chirp, a carry of a sound, a noise of.  A newspaper would not nor train, a circulation in the water or a hint of it, nor this nor this.  Nothing that is nature, nothing out, nothing made by nature or of nature would, that is, choose a silence of a stationary kind.  There is a fence and down and by the edges of, a less that could be more or even more.  At one time.</p>
<p>Of course the hurt is in remainders, how we stop or change or sway or coddle, chew or traipse or send when he would choose the other as a not and all of us not choose it.  And through the certain of a fence the lookers look from edge of it, no lookers in.  And then from of another course to see as yet another, here the less of one then two then three and every moving thing, and then the way the hands along a clock do move themselves and point to in until the no one here is looking at the all in silence in. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

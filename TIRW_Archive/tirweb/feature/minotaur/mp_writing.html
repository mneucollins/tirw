        <p><b>PEDAGOGY: TOWARD WRITING</b></p>
        <p><b>The digital writer's craft</b><br>
          Digital authors face a two-fold responsibility: constructing an intuitive, 
          technically adept navigational (communicative) system for the user, 
          and at the same time pushing their own literacies beyond print-based 
          habits to discover new ways of making meaning. Working in &quot;new 
          media&quot; means manipulating multidimensional technologies so as to 
          employ the specific potentials inherent in them. For instance, sound 
          authoring allows craft and communicative possiblities in a dimension 
          entirely removed from linear, visual text; access to a varied color 
          palette opens up a range of options untapped in monochromatic constructions; 
          animation allows for kinetic and dynamic semiotics; and so on. Crafting 
          a multimedia text that leverages several of these sub-media simultaneously 
          must be at times a boggling and alien means of conveying meaning. </p>
        <p>For White, summoning the ancient helps to ground the new. She calls 
          up the metaphor of ritual motion to link the past with the contemporary: 
          &quot;In order to unveil the image and activate the chanted dualities 
          [in Canto I], the reader must move the curser, a minute finger action 
          akin to counting prayer beads.&quot; Where manipulating Buddhist or 
          Catholic devices of observance summons spiritual insight, handling the 
          computer mouse in this case&#147;unveils&#148;another sort of enlightenment. 
          By degrees a suggested construct emerges: a cyborg ear and its dualistic 
          associations, audibly echoed by narrated binaries. Piecemeal revelation 
          is necessary to express a thing continually in flux&#151;the contemporary 
          human/machine connection&#151;and its understanding resists precise 
          expression, yielding instead to revelation by intuition and allusion. 
        </p>
        <p>The craft of the author is a delicate and deliberate project. White 
          notes that for her the composition process of digital work is fairly 
          organic, as she tries to &#147;grow [the text and multimedia elements] 
          up together as much as possible.&quot; For this reason it&#146;s important 
          to consider <i>The Minotaur Project</i> as an integrated whole that 
          refuses to privilege one mode (textual, graphical, etc.) over another. 
          Where some electronic works start out as print texts and are later adapted 
          to the digital platform, White's work began its existence as a hybrid-media 
          text. What White and digital authors like her are attempting to construct 
          is an entirely new literary form whose various multimedia elements contribute 
          as significantly as does text, are necessary to the logic of the whole.<b>

                      images comingle, the writing begins to evolve. My goal is 
                      to find ways to make image and text utterly dependent on 
                      each other. Image should not be mere illustration for text, 
                      it should play a role that the text absolutely cannot. The 
                      idea is to make sure the visual art, the sound, the movement, 
                      and the interactive elements are saying things that the 
                      fixed poem cannot say.</font></i> </font></p>

        <p><b>Some thoughts on the digital writer's tools</b><br>
          Throughout the text of <i>The Minotaur Project</i> White mines the terrain 
          of the sensate human body (ear, eye, tongue, fingertip) as material 
          for describing the complex and ephemeral concept of identity. Not only 
          does the digital composition itself serve as the material ground for 
          her exploration, but her choices of metaphoric elements&#151;for example 
          the fingerprint/tip as the bodily point at which unique identity is 
          instantiated&#151;illustrate the dialectic between body and spirit. 
        </p>
        <p>Tactically, she employs her available toolset to augment her meaning: 
          narrative technologies the reader navigates through active use of eyes, 
          ears, and fingertips to experience ideas that cannot exist without their 
          material embodiment. A text-based poem relies on a virtual call to the 
          senses through descriptive language; within the digital environment 
          this conventional application to the sensual world becomes all the more 
          palpable with graphics and animation. As a means to understanding digital 
          composition within the continuum of literature generally, I propose 
          examining the writer&#146;s tools and how they translate to the digital 
          environment. <br>
        </p>
        <p>In terms of the traditional act of writing, pen and paper or keyboard 
          and screen are usually about as far as customary identification of tools 
          goes. Hardware. </p>
        <p>Let&#146;s add to this list the &#147;soft&#148; tools: the ancient 
          technology of the alphabet; grammar, vocabulary, and syntax; the wealth 
          of accumulated literature, associative and fleeting, that resides in 
          the writer&#146;s head. When we write, we summon, often half-, if at 
          all, consciously, myriad resonances from foregoing literate experiences: 
          what we&#146;ve read in or out of school, oral narratives passed on 
          to us, themes we&#146;ve partially broached in our own writing past. 
          A nearly infinite number of particular influences and resonances, of 
          course, contribute to a writer&#146;s perspective in more individual 
          ways, but for my purposes here I&#146;ll restrict my list to things 
          that I might generalize as &#147;tools&#148;: pen/paper or keyboard/screen, 
          language, and literature.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Then I need to expand this rudimentary toolset to accommodate digital 
          composition. What indeed does it mean to &#147;write&#148; digitally? 
          Taking the specifics of <i>The Minotaur Project</i> as a test case, 
          we might extrapolate a variety of tools. </p>
        <p>First, to name White&#146;s traditional writing tools: keyboard/screen, 
          the English language, Greek mythology and Dante. In order to construct 
          her electronic piece, however, she needs further equipment and capabilities. 
          The Flash program is the most obvious, encapsulating within it an array 
          of sub-tools or literacies&#151;for example, the technical facility 
          with layers and palettes established by Flash&#146;s software predecessors 
          like Photoshop, as well as a related spectrum of image-manipulation 
          proficiency. </p>
        <p>On a fundamental level using a technological tool like Flash also demands 
          a general fluency with the multi-tasking windowed environment introduced 
          by the Mac OS and transparent to the PC user today. Computer literacy 
          as a whole in fact reads like an archaeology of accreted knowledges 
          that become invisible through use&#151;the ability to &#147;mouse&#148; 
          around the virtual graphical environment, to think at once sequentially 
          and across multiple simultaneities, to infer a whole page or progression 
          from a screen&#146;s worth of displayed information. </p>
        <p>This analytical process of breaking computer proficiency down into 
          sub-literacies could go on at some length; in the same way we could 
          enumerate the soft tools of traditional literacy exhaustively: argumentative 
          logic, socioculturally-specific humor, and so on. I&#146;ll confine 
          my list here to generalize Flash&#146;s sub-tools: image- and text-editing 
          and animation construction capabilities. </p>
        <p>Beyond this level of software and computer technological literacy, 
          though, there lurks yet another layer of meta-tools necessary for the 
          construction of a multimedia piece&#151;I&#146;ll call it simply &#147;media 
          literacy.&#148; By this I mean familiarity with the conventions of film, 
          television, music, and other products of the entertainment industries, 
          a pervading awareness that produces the capacity to frame a shot, fade 
          a scene, or appropriately integrate sound with visual effects. Media 
          literacy combines with computer literacy and traditional textual and 
          literary literacy to produce the intellectual tools of the digital writer.</p>
        <p><b>Writing the mind with the body</b><br>
          <br>
          Given digital authors&#146; investigations into new modes of writing, 
          I wonder how the composition technologies employed dictate the compositions 
          produced and, more to the point, what knowledge is gained through the 
          interaction with the particular media. As Hayles reminds us, channelling 
          McLuhan, that the medium is organic to the message: <i>The Minotaur 
          Project</i> would in no sense be <i>The Minotaur Project</i> were it 
          comprised exclusively of its text elements. If we consider the writing 
          act to be a functional process for learning, how then does the learning 
          change as the process changes with new tools? </p>

        <p>Composition theorist Janet Emig has described how writing operates 
          heuristically by engaging both hemispheres of the brain at once. She 
          compares composition to the three other traditional &#147;languaging 
          processes&#148;: listening, talking, and reading. Only writing constitutes 
          a developmental vehicle that combines simultaneously enactive, iconic 
          and representational levels of cognition. According to Emig, writing 
          exercises the widest spectrum of human cognitive capabilities<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">3</a>: writing transforms experience by 
          shaping the symbolic system of verbal language into the iconography 
          of text, which is in turn enacted by the hand in transcription. She 
          further notes the unique learning benefits of writing&#146;s cognitive 
          feedback loop, making what is known &quot;immediately and visibly available.&quot;</p>
        <p>Hayles<a href="footnotes.html" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onFocus="this.blur()">4</a>, in turn, writes of the &#147;proprieceptive&#148; 
          functions of computer-use, whereby the hand-eye engagement of employing 
          the mouse to accomplish ends within the field of the monitor&#146;s 
          terrain generates a similar physiological feedback loop. She cites the 
          tool use of seasoned tennis players, whose facility with the racquet 
          transforms it into an extension of their arm, and suggests that literate 
          computer users engage a similar bodily extension by moving the mouse, 
          an activity they eventually internalize. </p>
        <p>Given the conjunction of Emig&#146;s and Hayles&#146; descriptions 
          of the bio-psychic activities of writing and computer use, how much 
          more cognitively developmental might we consider writing with digital 
          tools. Electronic composition as undertaken by White conceivably harnesses 
          these developmental feedback loops even more elaborately in the employment 
          of constructing literal graphical images and animations. In order to 
          compose multimedia applications, the author performs the enactive, iconic 
          and representational mechanisms even more intensively than is possible 
          through textual signifiers. Digital composition, in effect, offers a 
          writing medium that more concretely employs verbal, graphic and dexterous 
          capabilities, standing to shape our ways of thinking in multiple dimensions.<a href="mp_literacy.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>Before you came to digital composition, you were a writer 
          and an artist in more traditional materials. Would you talk a bit about 
          how composing for hypermedia is different?</i></p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> The digital medium, which deals with image, text, movement, 
          performance, interactivity and sound, has a sort of ensemble composition 
          process, which might be akin to film-making. But it's different from 
          film-making because, at least for me, it's not a collaborative process. 
          As an author and an artist, I work alone at my desk creating these objects.</p>
        <p>How the electronic poem comes together in the composition process is, 
          like the page poem, a bit mysterious. It's hard for me to say how they 
          are different because they are so completely mingled in my head and 
          in my process. I still write poetry and prose that I don't put into 
          this medium and make visual art that does not have to co-exist with 
          words.
        <p>When I decide to make an electronic piece I deal with these issues: 
        <ul>
          <li> a different kind of pacing in an animated poem<br>
          <li> navigation-- pages are not turned; the site map is a kind of composition 
          in
          its own right<br>
          <li> the performance aspect of electronic poetry<br>
          <li> the computer as a character or agent of performance<br>
         <li> how to marry visual art composition with syntactical composition<br>
          <li> how to incorporate the interactive aspect in the electronic medium.</ul>
		  
          
        <p>I usually write first. Before the writing is finished, I begin to incoporate 
          visual art and animation. When the text and images comingle, the writing 
          begins to evolve. My goal is to find ways to make image and text utterly 
          dependent on each other. Image should not be mere illustration for text, 
          it should play a role that the text absolutely cannot. The idea is to 
          make sure the visual art, the sound, the movement, and the interactive 
          elements are saying things that the fixed poem cannot say. So I try 
          to grow them up together as much as possible. </p>
        <p>And I've done that with varing degrees of success. In this project, 
          the most successful canto is the first. In &quot;The Cartesian Chant 
          of Making&quot; my goal was to use the interactive element to make the 
          reading of the work into a chant or meditation on duality and creation. 
          In order to unveil the image and activate the chanted dualities, the 
          reader must move the curser, a minute finger action akin to counting 
          prayer beads. The underlying image reveales a combination of flesh and 
          machine. The system of temporary unveiling (and chanting) is organized 
          into a grid. The grid itself has a whole system of symbolic meaning 
          which adds silently to the content of the piece. </p>
        <p><i><b>ST:</b> You have commented elsewhere that, in this piece at least, 
          digital composition isn't primarily collaborative for you&#151; and 
          indeed one of the things I love about your work here is how it seems 
          to express a singular, individual vision (I have to admit I tend to 
          be pretty Modernist in my aesthetic). But you also credit your husband 
          Mike on </i>The Minotaur Project<i>. How did your respective roles there 
          play out?</i> <br>

        <p><b>KW:</b> The technical assistance I received was minimal. When I 
          got stuck Mike helped me figure the problem out. But I did everything 
          else, top to bottom, took the photos, recorded the voice, wrote the 
          text, did the Photoshop and Flash work, etc. I share your attraction 
          to the singular vision. Ready-mades and art that exists as an illustration 
          of theory is not as compelling to me as the hand-made, personal object.</p>
        <p>I started working with Mike on the project before I actually started 
          writing it. I had some drafts, but I wasn&#146;t sure how the Minotaur 
          and Kore were going to interact. Mike is a brilliant artist and his 
          first instinct was to make an image, to draw the character. He depicted 
          Minotaur as a kind of sad angel, misunderstood and lonely. He made a 
          Quicktime movie which was really beautiful, but I could see right away 
          that it wasn&#146;t going to work. The character he made was endearing 
          and heartbreaking, and would need a story with a beginning, a middle, 
          and an end. That was different from what I wanted to do.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
		<p>I wanted to write something fragmentary, and I wanted my Minotaur to 
          be invisible. So we put aside the Quicktime sketch and Mike started 
          drafting things in Flash. I had an idea for a kind of yin-yang animation. 
          The red and white shapes, the pink line and the gray shim, these all 
          had meanings but they were too meaningy. Too intellectual with nothing 
          to hook you, no human entry-point.</p>
       
        <p>Finally, I pushed Mike out of the chair and began to do it myself. 
          It just didn&#146;t work to dictate to someone else and have him try 
          to interpret it. </p>
        <p>Late one night I took a picture of my ear with the digital camera and 
          married it with an image of a circuit board and everything fell into 
          place. That idea never would have happened if I hadn&#146;t been struggling 
          with the software myself. <a href="interview_p3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

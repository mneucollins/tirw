          Canto II: Eye</b>
		  <p>
          &#147;Cyclops Me with My Only Eye&#148; plays with the notion of sight 
          and being seen. White translates Homer&#146;s monocular monster onto 
          a digital stage&#151;the photorealistic human eye blinking at the reader 
          from the center of the electronic page glares in an inhuman hue of red 
          reminiscent of the LED bulbs that signal the life inside our thinking 
          machines. Epigraphic text opening the page describes this mechanism 
          as cyborg combination of organic and mechanical:&quot;forehead jewel 
          rolled in saltwater/ nerved to the brain&#146;s chip, ticking/ [corporate] 
          image bank.&quot; The brain, keyed by the eye, functions centrally as 
          both nervous system and repository of the myriad signifiers of the marketplace, 
          tell-tale anxiety in the shutter-click sound, the &#147;ticking&#148; 
          blink of a mechanical thing overheated, ready, perhaps, to explode. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>What is the source of such anxiety? One of the preoccupations of the 
          postindustrial age as represented in futuristic media tales<a href="footnotes.html" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onFocus="this.blur()">9</a> is the persistence of video reproduction 
          and surveillance. In a society where television and video prevail, visual 
          reality is perpetually reduplicated, played back to us in constant reiteration; 
          within a consumerist and information-hungry culture image captures from 
          hidden surveillance cameras empower department store detectives and 
          governmental agents alike. Authors like Don Delillo (<i>Mao II</i>, 
          <i>White Noise</i>) highlight the ways in which our contemporary lives 
          are awash in a barrage of our own simulacra, while television shows 
          like The X-Files posit a Panoptic world where power is wielded by those 
          we can&#146;t see but who can, disturbingly and seemingly omnisciently, 
          observe us. Michel Foucault has described the function of this surveying 
          power to discipline.<a href="footnotes.html" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"

          Canto II considers the subjectivity constructed by this collection of 
          the body&#146;s data. The speaking voice issues from the Minotaur/cyborg 
          and addresses the Kore persona of the poet: &quot;I register undetectable 
          thought glean/ with electric feeler/ I read you, everything about you/ 
          is contained/ in data&#151;/ therapist&#146;s notes&#151;emotions history/ 
          doctors&#146; measure of blood&#146;s pressure.&quot;The construing 
          eye is at once inside and outside, the panoptic gaze internalized, as 
          the material self is interpenetrated by the informational patterns of 
          the digitized world. In a post-structural sense, Kore becomes the &#147;measure&#148; 
          of the data about her, the &#147;notes&#148; and &#147;measures&#148; 
          observed and recorded by institutional authorities standing in for identity. 
          As the iterated object of this scrutiny she becomes subject to both 
          evaluation and discipline. The examination, surrounded by all its documentary 
          techniques, makes each individual a &#147;case.&quot;<a href="footnotes.html" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onFocus="this.blur()">11</a><br>
        </p>
        <p>The &#147;monster&#148; then is the self as interpolated by technology 
          and its disciplining systems of measurement and evaluation. Integrating 
          and interpreting ourselves via the media at our command cuts both ways: 
          on the one hand allowing the construction of distinct identity, on the 
          other hybridizing us such that autonomy apart from the machine is no 
          longer possible. <a href="mp_tongue.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

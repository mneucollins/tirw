        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>You mentioned that you're still adding to the project, 
          and the &quot;About&quot; page indicates a larger work&#151; would you 
          describe what that is?</i></p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> I am imagining Kore&#146;s Dantesque journey through the 
          underworld but instead of Virgil, she has an electronic manifestation 
          of the Minotaur as her guide. I am imagining an extended narrative for 
          Kore and most, if not all, of it will appear in an electronic format. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>At one stage of its development the trilogy began with a novel section 
          with a circular rather than a linear narrative. The setting was Circleville, 
          Ohio, and the reader entered the work through an introduction called 
          &quot;Home Burial.&quot; As you read, the table of contents would build 
          in the background&#151; a mandala that contained all the sections of 
          the body of the novel. You could read them in any order or skip over 
          them entirely and go to the exit (so read as either novel or short story). 
        </p>
        <p>Once you finished the final text, the mandala then collapsed and reformed 
          into a wireframe globe or cage structure, trapping the reader inside. 
          This was the framework for the second part of the trilogy, called &quot;The 
          Hellcycle&quot;. This section was written entirely in verse, and it's 
          the landscape that the Minotaur occupies. </p>
        <p>I then planned a third movement called &quot;The Return.&quot; For 
          that I wanted the sense of lucid, above-ground, prosiness to contrast 
          with the denser, more intuitive language of poetry for the below-ground 
          story. </p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of Dante and was thinking about his trilogy when I 
          decided on this structure. Unfortunately, I'm finding it much more difficult 
          to bring prose into this medium. Partly because there is so much more 
          text and Flash isn't good with text. Partly, too, because I find it's 
          harder to integrate this volume of text and image without frustrating 
          its legibility. It's more difficult to abandon the convention of the 
          page. </p>
        <p>In any case, I'm now rethinking how to adapt my ideas to the available 
          technology. This project has been very slow to evolve. I was hoping 
          to create and release a few sections at a time, but it&#146;s not working 
          out that way. Each subsequent section seems to need the next section 
          to feel complete. So it looks like I will have to make a very large 
          piece that will include the Minotaur Project as perhaps the only stand-alone 
          element.</p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>Apart from this series, what other hypermedia works do 
          you have in the cooker?</i></p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> My newest piece is an online journal called <i>The New Disease</i> 
          (<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ekw96/" target="new">http://www.columbia.edu/~kw96/</a>), 
          a collection of fictional nonfiction&#151;stories about diseases like 
          <i>Geusis Nervosa</i>, a taste delay syndrome which afflicts anorexics 
          and bulimics; an STD that&#146;s communicated through the ear from phone 
          sex; and a new club drug called &#145;thrax, made from a non-lethal 
          strain of anthrax. </p>
        <p>We are interested in how the reader can affect the narrative and, conversely, 
          how the narrative affects, or infects, the reader, and we wanted to 
          address narrative in the web environment, where the story can be added 
          to, montaged.<br>
        </p>
        <p><i>The New Disease</i> is essentially collaborative, much more so than 
          anything else I&#146;ve done. Working with design and visual elements 
          is usually an integral part of my process, but with <i>The New Disease</i>, 
          I made a conscious decision to turn over the site design entirely to 
          Mike. Devin and I did the writing and purposely did not include author 
          taglines on the pieces we wrote. In a very real way, we are also collaborating 
          with the readers (via the &#147;talk back&#148; sections). The intent 
          here is to produce a work that does not privilege authorship. <br>
        </p>
        <p>I am also interested in how self-definition evolves in terms of a medical 
          condition, and vice-versa. But this is a theme that runs through all 
          of my work. I have a collection of prose poems that imagines the body 
          transforming and mutating to manifest something that is happening below 
          the surface. I have this very romantic notion of the body as expressive 
          object. The prose poems explore a kind of magical realism of the body. 
          I think this shows up in The Minotaur Project as well. The senses serve 
          as interface between inner and outer. Those liminal zones, where a transaction 
          between a self and a world takes place, are particularly interesting 
          to me because their significance is largely overlooked, yet our humanity 
          hangs on them.</p>
        <p>The senses serve as interface between inner and outer. These liminal

        <p><i>The Minotaur Project</i> imagines an insensate consciousness. Minotaur 
          is an intelligent machine, a kind of Pinnoccio character, who wants 
          to be human but lacks the necessary flesh and blood.</p>
        <p>My Minotaur has been housed in the ethernet for four years. Spinning 
          its numbers without pause. I don&#146;t imagine that he can consume 
          anyone, but he does mesmerize the female character in the poems. He 
          is obsessed with her as well. They are mutually obsessed.</p>
        <p>This metaphor of the half-human monster trapped in a maze of technology 
          and trying to find his humanity is also a reference to modern urban 
          life. New Yorkers, for example, who live inside machines&#151;subways, 
          buses, cars, those big buildings with windows you can&#146;t open...</p>
        <p>Even our communication is through machines. Email is the most extreme 
          example, none of the senses connect with the other person, at least 
          on the phone you hear a voice, you can detect mood, personality. You 
          can make a connection because of that. Imagine all the human information 
          you lose in email. The Minotaur Project is about that loss.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>And now&#151;is it superstition?&#151;for some reason 
          I begin to fear I've committed some trespass behind the creative curtain. 
          Not that I actually have any suspicion that a mechanistic breakdown 
          threatens to denude such mysterious and multilayered work&#151;but I 
          suppose I&#146;m indoctrinated in the etiquette of sparing the made 
          work the disrespect of too close an examination. </i><i>I hope, both 
          because I know you and because I know you&#146;re interested like me 
          in the teaching of hypermedia works, that you&#146;ll appreciate my 
          intentions. </i></p>
        <p><i>It seems to me that before the &#147;avant-garde&#148; can truly 
          communicate with a broader audience (and surely the classroom is part 
          of this) we need to develop explicit, detailed, and not too high-flown 
          ways of talking about it. Then, too, from my experience in the Iowa 
          Writers&#146; Workshop I know the damage that too precious a mystique 
          of &#147;the Writer&#148; can beget. So please bear with me if I've 
          risked treading slipshod on any artistic holies. </i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> Actually, I think your reading enhances the work. You know 
          how a sculpture gets shiny where people touch it? That&#146;s the mystery 
          spot, that&#146;s the connection. Without it we&#146;ve failed in a 
          sense. <img src="x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

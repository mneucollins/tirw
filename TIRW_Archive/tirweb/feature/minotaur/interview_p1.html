        <p><b>Sarah Townsend:</b> <i>I distinctly recall the first moment I experienced 
          your piece </i>The Minotaur Project<i>&#151;after years of writing poetry 
          and making personal narrative web sites, I found myself one day doing 
          Google searches on the web in an attempt to canvas this hybrid thing, 
          new to me, called &#147;electronic literature&#148; or &#147;new media 
          poetry.&#148; That's what led me to the <a href="http://www.eliterature.org/Awards2001/" target="new">Electronic 
          Literature Organization&#146;s 2001 prize page</a> where, going first 
          to the Poetry short list, I encountered your piece. </i></p>
        <p><i>And it surprised me&#151;half of the six works listed there turned 
          out not to be web-enabled. </i>The Minotaur Project, <i>however, </i><i> 
          was&#151;and its ready availability, along with its deceptive clarity, 
          was one of the things that enabled it to grab me at first. </i></p>
        <p><i>After that I would have to describe the main force of my attraction 
          to it as </i>textural<i>&#151;that is, on one level the operation of 
          a seeming tactile quality on my senses, even within a &#147;disembodied&#148; 
          medium; it is a sensual piece. But also it is a </i>smart<i> piece&#151;one 
          that immediately struck me with its leveraging at once of classical 
          mythology and contemporary scientific logic and discourse. </i></p>
        <p><i>This, too, is what I mean by its &#147;texture&#148;&#151;that it 
          acts upon me as a reader/viewer with an ambidextrous touch, at once 
          </i>think<i>y and </i>feel<i>y. And this is what I continue to love 
          about it&#151;that upon repeated visits I continue to be drawn into 
          new levels and ways of receiving it: as a visual art piece, as a sound 
          collage, as a poem collection, as a critical proposition, and as something 
          beyond and comprised by the conjunction of all these things. </i><br>

        <p><b>Kim White:</b> I love your reading.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>Well, admittedly, I&#146;m partial. :-) </i><i>So 
          I wonder&#151;beyond wholesale endorsement by those of us fortunate 
          enough to experience love at first sight&#151;what might you hope for 
          from your hypermedia readers? How do you imagine, for instance, a novice 
          to hypermedia works mght approach </i>The Minotaur Project<i>&#151;what 
          steps in reading, receiving and responding? In part I&#146;m interested 
          here as a teacher of literature and writing, two disciplines that are 
          too often pedagogically split, in my opinion.</i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> When approaching a hypermedia work, I look to see if it 
          can give me something that traditional media can&#146;t. For example, 
          if I see a poem or story that has been put into digital format, but 
          has kept all the conventions of the page, then I&#146;m not very interested. 
          I would rather read it on paper. I&#146;m excited by work that understands 
          the relationship between form and content. That examines new media critically, 
          and uses it to do what literature has always done&#151;express our humanity 
          in the context of our struggle. </p>
        <p>The first Canto is intended as a meditation. I was experimenting with 
          ways of drawing the reader into a work that is somewhat devoid of narrative 
          and lyrical armatures. Canto One uses an interactive chant to evoke 
          an interior mood. I was interested in how this very old form of introspection 
          would work grafted into a new medium? I was also thinking about Hopi 
          sand paintings when I created the image, which reveals and disappears 
          as the curser moves across the screen. The ephemeral nature of the sand 
          paintings and the chant form seemed like a good metaphor for the fragility 
          of the electronic medium.</p>
        <p>To parse this work I would examine it in layers: the poem which dissolves 
          on the surface of the blank ground, the animated grid, the soundscape/chant, 
          the interactive aspect, and the underlying image. I imagine these &#147;layers&#148; 
          could be considered in the same way you would a line or a stanza extracted 
          from a poem&#151;looking simultaneously at its particular qualities 
          and how it informs the work as a whole. <a href="interview_p2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

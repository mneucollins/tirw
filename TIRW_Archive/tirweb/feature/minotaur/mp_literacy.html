        <p><b>THE DIGITAL REDEFINING LITERACY</b></p>
        <p>Cumulatively White composes, through her text, a self for her reader 
          to navigate and discover. Ordinarily by &#147;writing&#148; we mean 
          the expression of ideas through textual signifiers, but as my discussion 
          above has suggested, the digital writer&#146;s productions also incorporate 
          the increasingly imagistic gestures of our contemporary culture. </p>
        <p>As Hollywood, MTV, and the Web all trump their less graphical forebears, 
          our sense of writing expands to consider visual iconography as a representational 
          alphabet akin to text. As regular people ingest technical discourses 
          and material techniques of film and television, our definition of literacy 
          must evolve to reach beyond traditional alphabetic literacy. The more 
          we &#147;read&#148; a multi-dimensional and multi-layered text of images 
          and sounds as well as language elements in our diverse, multiply mediated 
          world, the more fluently capable we become to &#147;write&#148; using 
          these same diverse and complementary literacies. This evolution to a 
          writing that is more visual and animated has a number of intents and 
          effects.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Questions of Interactivity</b><br>
          Early on new media critics focused their discussions of hypertext interactivity 
          on the function of links.<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">5</a> Many of these theorists contended 
          that hyperlinks draw the reader to into a more collaborative construction 
          of the text, providing a multiplicity of paths through the material 
          for the reader to navigate.1 It seems clear that multimedia works like 
          <i>The Minotaur Project</i> invite a thorough-going reevaluation of 
          hyperliterature interactivity. </p>
        <p>As I&#146;ve described, Flash allows the writer to compose a cohesive 
          narrative object that combines image, sound, animation, and sophisticated 
          text effects. Early-adopters of digital writing programs employed the 
          technologies available to them, for the most part text-heavy environments 
          like StorySpace. Of course, with each year that passes, computer users&#151;both 
          those who consume and those who produce digital texts&#151;grow increasingly 
          sophisticated, as do the tools at their disposal. People continue to 
          experiment with different approaches to making digital literature &#147;interactive&#148;: 
          from collaborative story sites on the Web and projects that join forces 
          of poets and programmers to text algorithms that generate &#147;custom&#148; 
          pieces on the fly according to user-defined parameters. </p>
        <p>Our notions of literacy, media and otherwise, are undergoing rapid 
          revision and reinterpretation&#151;and as tools continue to develop 
          and people to push on the technologies at their disposal, we&#146;ll 
          continue, no doubt, to see a collapsing of the boundaries that separate 
          &#147;literature&#148; from &#147;art&#148; or &#147;animation.&#148; 
          In the course of this progression, and with works like <i>The Minotaur 
          Project</i> that more actively engage the body to &#147;make sense&#148; 
          of the material presented, I&#146;d like to suggest a different notion 
          of interactivity: one in which the sensory physics of the body joins 
          with the analytical and creative capacities of the mind to create a 
          deeply engaging textual experience. </p>
        <p>Mass media products tend to rely on &#147;push&#148; technology (consumption)&#151;we 
          watch movies and television largely passively, commonly for the pure 
          enjoyment of escaping reality. White notes a potential for interactive 
          multimedia, a technology in which the user &#147;pulls&#148; information 
          to her, to co-opt the techniques of film and television for literary 
          production, an undertaking little mined in traditional literature.<br>
          <br>
          White envisions for hypermedia literature an activist agenda: to reclaim 
          the technologies of popular culture for the purposes of the literary 
          arts. Just as educational multimedia (&#147;edutainment&#148;) leverage 
          the engaging principles of cartoons for learning, electronic literature 
          concocts a hybrid literature that draws on reading modes inherent to 
          more popular contexts<a href="mp_eye.html"></a>.</p>
        <p>Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">6</a> draws a distinction between the 
          digital writer&#146;s conscious troubling of her media and traditional 
          literary practice which he suggests tends to assume the neutrality of 
          its technologies. Technological literacy critic Cynthia Selfe<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">7</a> questions the &#147;naturalization&#148; 
          of technology, and Christina Haas<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">8</a> stresses, &#147;literacy practiced 
          via print is no less technological than is literacy practiced via electronics.&#148; 
          She adds, however, that in their ubiquity &#147;books can appear to 
          be non-technological.&#148; </p>
        <p>Because digital media are newer and consequently less naturalized, 
          the artificiality of their device is more apparent to us. Digital media 
          writers trouble the transparency of literary construction by rendering 
          it opaque: electronic compositions like <i>The Minotaur Project</i> 
          foreground both the technologies of production and what Glazier, drawing 
          on a tradition of language poetry, terms the &#147;materiality of language&#148; 
          itself. Glazier notes that in throwing naturalized processes into relief, 
          &#147;e-poetry engages economic, ideological, and social factors,&#148; 
          pursuing larger society&#146;s questions. </p>
        <p>In the case of White&#146;s construction, the digital realm is at once 
          an appropriate and a troubling medium for investigating the author&#146;s 
          ambivalences about her cyborg hybridity in contemporary culture. The 
          migration of poetry in particular&#151;an artform historically rooted 
          in, indeed synonymous with, humanism&#151;to a technological platform 
          calls forth common anxieties and fascinations regarding human being 
          meeting machine. And yet how better to address that anxiety than through 
          the materiality of the medium employed? Digital poetry, with its literary 
          tradition of summoning sensory perception in order to mobilize ideological 
          questions, offers perhaps the most appropriate means of answering Hayles&#146; 
          call for attention to both the informational patterns and their material 
          expressions. <i>The Minotaur Project </i>examines the &#147;condition 
          of virtuality&#148; through both thematic and concrete means, and the 
          result is a whole new breed of literature and literacy. <a href="mp_ear.html">[Reading the <em>Cantos</em>]</a></p>

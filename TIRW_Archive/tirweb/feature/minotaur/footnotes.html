        <P> 1. According to Hayles, molecular biology and other information sciences since 
          World War II have contributed to the collective, and naturalized, assumption 
          that the theoretical and the physical are in some sense separable&#151;a 
          dichotomy which, she notes, &#147;maps onto the older and more traditional 
          dictotomy of spirit/matter.&#148; This hierarchical split has manifested 
          in an array of Western traditions: from a Platonic ideal that proposes 
          the immaterial essence superior to its physical counterpart to Christian 
          doctrine which values the life of the spirit over that of the body to 
          our contemporary Information Age where, for all our fascination with 
          fetishistic electronic devices, it is data that ultimately rules. And 
          as we promote information patterns to an immortal status, we hope to 
          render them immune to the forces that decay physical objects&#151;attributing 
          to the spirit a life beyond the death of the body or preserving our 
          data from destruction by duplication and distribution. Hayles reminds 
          us that the split is artificial from the outset&#151; information/ matter, 
          data/machine, body/spirit, text/meaning: each cannot exist without the 
          other. The ephemeral energy relies on its contextual framework and embodying 
          substance, particularly in the case of present-day experiences of &#147;virtuality.&#148;<br>

        <P>3. Drawing on the earlier work of cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner, 
          she outlines our primary means of representing and processing lived 
          experience. (1) enactive&#151;we learn &#147;by doing&#148;; (2) iconic&#151;we 
          learn &#147;by depiction in an image&#148;; and (3) representational 
          or symbolic&#151;we learn by restatement in words. To overste the matter, 
          in enactive learning, the hand predominates; in iconic, the eye; and 
          in symbolic, the brain. <br>

          of meaning making that we think of as reading&#133; The selections aggregate 
          into a kind of contingent interpretation of the text at hand.&quot;

        <P>Kaplan does an impressive job of taking on both the arguments for and 
          against hyperlinks&#146; empowerment of the reader. She notes Myron 
          Tuman&#146;s objection to their &#147;invitation to click mindlessly 
          along&#148; and refutes it with a convincing case for the &#147;deeper 
          engagement with the text&#148; links facilitate by fostering &#147;reading 
          twice&#148;: acting as signifiers that speak on both the literal verbal 
          level and as meta-textual pointers, connecting resonances between different 
          portions of the text. She also debates the simplistic generalizations 
          that print new media critics leap to when expressing the innovative 
          nature of hypertext, by reminding us that readers often engage with 
          printed texts in willful and non-linear ways. On one hand Flash pieces 
          may merely do more of the same&#151;providing the reader with clickable 
          hotspots similar to those that can be programmed in HTML or StorySpace 
          and presenting a many-layered text akin to rich print literature for 
          the reader to plunder at will. On the other hand, hypermedia works may 
          move us toward a more truly embodied interaction between writer and 
          reader.</P>

        <p>9. From Willy Wonka (1971) to Max Headroom (1985), The Truman Show 
          (1998) to Pleasantville (1998), Hollywood has foregrounded contemporary 
          culture's anxiety about the power of video to reproduce, and consequently 
          render less human, human life. In other films like Blade Runner (1982) 
          and Brazil (1985) the consequences of video use for surveillance becomes 
          a more salient preoccupation than simulacra. But either way, video implies 
          an onmiscient but not entirely benificent entity and mankind subject 
          to its directional whim.</p>
        <p>10. &quot;Thanks to the techniques of surveillance, the 'physics' of power, 
          the hold over the body, operate according to the laws of optics and 
          mechanics&#133; It is a power that seems all the less 'corporal' in 
          that it is more subtly 'physical'.&quot; <br>

          normalized, excluded, etc.&quot;<br>

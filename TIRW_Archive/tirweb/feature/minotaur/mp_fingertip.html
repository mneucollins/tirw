        Canto IV: Fingertip</b> 
        <p>
          The work&#146;s final primary section rounds out the human sensory theme 
          by considering the closeup of a fingertip. &#147;In this maze we make 
          trade&#148; focuses on questions of identity as marked by the singular 
          patterns of the fingerprint. Here White again employs her digital tools 
          to inflect the text&#146;s meaning further than print would allow. The 
          canto presents the two halves of a dialogue between the Minotaur and 
          Kore anchoring the page at either pole. With animation White &#147;lifts&#148; 
          a portion closing the Minotaur&#146;s utterance above, shuffles it and 
          recombines it below as the opening to Kore&#146;s response. This anagram 
          literally highlights the identity duality central to the poem, enacting 
          it through the black letter fill of the words above flushing out of 
          their typographic containers and spinning along the fingertip&#146;s 
          whorls and into place in the words below. <br>
        </p>
        <p>This material animation questions the assumed neutrality of textual 
          signifiers for conveying meaning, one of the prevailing projects of 
          hyperliterature according to Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier, Director of 
          the Electronic Poetry Center at SUNY Buffalo. Problematizing the vehicles 
          of language necessarily asks both how much the idea and its expression 
          are one and also to what extent the two influence each other. If an 
          element is not neutral, it must carry a charge. For White this &#147;charge&#148; 
          is conveyed in the distinctive pattern of the fingerprint that rearranges 
          the meaning of the canto&#146;s lines: bodily self and collected data 
          react with one another to generate identity. In the course of this transformation, 
          the &#147;K&#148; of Kore gets set apart at the center of the fingertip&#146;s 
          own labyrinthine pattern, further reminding the reader of the play on 
          Kore/core as a central embodiment of identity. Just as the mythological 
          Kore&#146;s identity or &#147;meaning&#148; was constructed, shaped 
          by her experience, so too is the speaker&#146;s. Mythological figures 
          and the circumstances they face serve archetypically as investigations 
          of themes at play in human lives, and here the analogous Kore undergoes 
          identity-construction in the process of particularization. At the outset 
          of her story she is a cipher&#151;daughter to Demeter, but essentially 
          void of signification of her own&#151;until her journey into the underworld. 
          It is through the ambivalent choices she makes (picking the narcissus, 
          swallowing the pomegranate seeds) that a particular pattern develops 
          that defines her identity and fate: the first choice accomplishes her 
          abduction by Hades, while the latter defines the terms of her ongoing 
          sequestration and, consequently, her mythological &#147;meaning&#148;.

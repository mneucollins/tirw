        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>I&#146;d like to hear a little bit more about your own 
          initial process of conceiving the piece&#151;where did </i>The Minotaur 
          Project<i> begin?</i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> When I started writing this I had just finished reading 
          Pound&#146;s Cantos and was inspired by the audacity of his project&#151;to 
          write a mythology of all people, in a world that was shrinking even 
          then. But I was also struck by how he used images in his Cantos. They 
          never look like illustrations. They function as characters or hieroglyphs, 
          he successfully made images part of the text itself.</p>
        <p>Pound was working with many different languages in his Cantos and that 
          instinct seems appropriate in new media work where there is lots of 
          talk about &#147;image as text.&#148; Although this concept shouldn&#146;t 
          be taken to the extreme, I do think it is appropriate to think about. 
          Certainly there is a language of icons and logos in our late-capitalist 
          culture that even the non-literate can &#147;read.&#148; I am interested 
          in how this image literacy will manifest in stories and poems. I tried 
          to work with image the same way a poet working in traditional forms 
          innovates to conform to the sonnet structure. I wanted to make the writing 
          work within a visual, aural and interactive context.</p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>You know, I think it's interesting how we both self-identify 
          as Modernists aesthetically&#151; and you even note Pound's inspiration</i><i>. 
          But Eliot and Pound were part of a fairly male New Critical world. So 
          I&#146;d like to ask about </i>The Minotaur Project<i> as the work of 
          an artist who is a woman. Especially considering that this piece centers 
          on Kore or Persephone, who is such an iconic figure for the metaphoric 
          feminine fertility. In the mythology she swallows the pomegranate seeds 
          with the resultant season of barrenness, her body&#146;s tie the land. 
          And it strikes me that even her name invokes, or anticipates, that term 
          from feminist art history, the &quot;central </i>core<i> imagery&quot; 
          graphically exploited by Judy Chicago and often attributed to Georgia 
          O'Keefe's work. It may not be too much of a stretch to see your ear 
          or mouth depicted as a variation on this theme, the cybernetic orifice. 
          </i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> I mention Pound as an influence, but only in relation to 
          something he was trying to do formally. Pound is not someone I go to 
          on a regular basis. His work does not have the qualities that really 
          excite me. </p>
        <p>It's strange to me how sensuality is traditionally seen as feminine 
          and intellect as masculine, since, in fact, both men and women manifest 
          these traits in equal amounts. I don&#146;t think of the senses as subordinate 
          to the intellect. They can be trained and developed just as the mind 
          can be. Reading poetry, for example, this is done with the senses as 
          well as with the mind. So that is all to say that I don&#146;t privilege 
          thought over sensation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To identify what one brings to a work because of, or in spite of, his/her 
          gender is an interesting thought experiment. I like your reading of 
          my work in relation to the &#147;central core&#148; idea. Rather than 
          referring to the womb (or the entrance to/exit from the womb) I&#146;m 
          referring to the mouth/tongue or the &#147;voice&#148; and therefore 
          the individual identity of the woman as a trope on &#147;the core.&#148; 
          The choice of Persephone/Kore foregrounds the generative powers of women 
          and how they are subverted or &#147;put underground&#148; by men and 
          the cultural barrenness that results. It is interesting to think about 
          how the digital age might perpetuate that. For starters, someone should 
          look at how the structure of computer code corresponds to male thought 
          patterns. Everything is literal cause/effect.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>One of the reasons I inquire about you as a woman artist, 
          of course, is because you had a baby not long ago (here at first I typed 
          &#147;given your son&#146;s birth,&#148; &#147;due to your pregnancy&#148;&#151; 
          language being so insistently generative). </i></p>
        <p>The Minotaur Project<i> deals so eloquently with the body and its points 
          of ingress and egress, beginning with that gauzed-over navel on the 
          title page. It seems your experience of conceiving and carrying and 
          giving birth to another human being in the interim since you created 
          the piece must provide some points of reflection&#151;whether toward 
          clarification or obfuscation or greater complexity or simply different 
          emphasis, I wonder. </i></p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> I wonder if women always have an awareness of creating in 
          a physical sense? I was drawn to Persephone because I wanted to examine 
          how women and their generative powers are diminished. Young women are 
          never thought of as the source. They are habitually depicted as powerless 
          or as powerful only in the sense that they are sexually interesting. 
          Now that I&#146;ve experienced first-hand the enormous physical effort 
          involved in making a human being, I realize how taken-for-granted that 
          contribution is.</p>
        <p>Having a teenage girl as my central character was a decision to forefront 
          a woman just coming into her childbearing phase. Essentially, this is 
          what the myth is about, the incredible power a young woman has. Without 
          her the entire planet goes barren. Without her there is nothing. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, in classical myth, Persephone never gives birth to her 
          own child. Though she seems to pine for one. Her efforts are entirely 
          taken up with making the crops grow and, on the flipside (or underside), 
          governing the dead. In a way she&#146;s a tragic character who didn&#146;t 
          choose this life but is now stuck on a kind of treadmill.</p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>One thing that&#146;s been on my mind lately is&#133; 
          how to put this most accurately&#133; the range, and limits, of the 
          creative potentialities inherent to a woman of a certain age. There 
          are, of course, a lot of things that come into this: motherhood (the 
          biological), scholarly and professional work (the intellectual/critical), 
          as well as other more personally inflected creative endeavors like poetry 
          and collage (the artistic). </i></p>
        <p><i>As I write this, I realize how I&#146;ve intuitively (and some might 
          say mistakenly&#151; for instance, splitting &quot;intellect&quot; from 
          &quot;art&quot;...) portioned these energies out into three distinct 
          realms. Be that as it may, one of the reasons I love your work so much 
          is that it brings this split together&#151;in it I see themes of all 
          three sorts emerging and being interwoven in the most wonderful and 
          fertile and troubling ways. </i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> True, at a certain age there is enormous &#147;output&#148;. 
          It is unique to women, the experience of making a new person alongside 
          her other creative and professional projects. Hard to say exactly how 
          that influences&#133;<br>
        </p>
        <p>My work has always made references to the body and its systems. Since 
          becoming a mother, I have been thinking a lot about war and birth. Again, 
          my obsession with dichotomies&#151;the woman gestates and gives birth 
          and the men (though not exclusively) go to war and destroy all that 
          work. <br>
        </p>
        <p>I also wonder at the similarities. The pain for instance&#151;pregnancy, 
          labor and delivery, the sleep deprivation of post-partum has to be equal 
          to what gets experienced on the battlefield in terms of physical pain 
          and exhaustion. I&#146;m interested in where two extremes collide and 
          collude, the visual metaphor of the yin/yang, which shows opposites 
          pressing against one another. In the center of each is a speck of its 
          opposite. The idea is that as soon as it gets completely dark, the light 
          starts and vice-versa. The farther you get into one extreme the sooner 
          the inevitable return. Birth/death, male/female, intellect/intuition, 
          etc..<br>
        </p>
        <p>The first Canto addresses this love of duality in our culture. I titled 
          it in reference to Cartesian coordinates. I wanted to foreground the 
          grid, which is used both in visual art and in science to describe space. 
          I imagine that our cultural preoccupation with dualities is embodied 
          in this linear conception of the architecture of our world. I am somewhat 
          obsessed with the grid, which I disbelieve and believe at the same time. 
          At one point, I had all the other Kore poems arranged in a grid pattern 
          with four, four-line stanzas, eight syllables each, with a rhyme scheme 
          at the corner points connecting them.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>ST:</b><i> It seems clear that part of your project in this work 
          is the complication of habitual divisions.&#147;The Cartesian Chant 
          of Making&#148; says in effect, &#147;There are these conflicting and 
          colliding pressures in our lives&quot; and then goes on to cast them 
          in an indivisible and constantly-shifting mosaic, illegible except in 
          motion and taken as a whole.</i></p>
        <p><b>KW: </b>Yes, I&#146;m interested in how we harbor dichotomies. It&#146;s 
          an internal conflict that is below the surface for everyone. The resonance 
          of opposites creates a kind of flux. I&#146;m looking at ways in which 
          the balance or imbalance of that tension becomes productive.</p>
        <p><b>ST:</b> <i>To what extent do you think this blending is in fact 
          the potential of the medium revealing itself? Multimedia seems the most 
          inherently apt vehicle for addressing collisions and conflicts and eerie 
          emerging hybridities. And it has struck me in my own creative work that 
          production tends to be some alchemy of intention and found brilliance 
          borrowed from available media. </i><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>KW:</b> I guess the medium has a life of its own in a sense. I was 
          a sculptor years ago and when I worked in stone, I had very specific 
          notions about what that stone &#147;wanted to be&#148;. It&#146;s not 
          unusual for a stone sculptor to feel that he is somehow co-creating 
          with the stone. In multimedia, you have this thing that seems alive, 
          flickering electric like a body or a brain. The character traits of 
          the material are unavoidably incorporated and that is as it should be. 
          I think that is part of knowing your craft. I like this idea of the 
          medium as an &#147;apt vehicle for addressing those eerie emerging hybridities.&#148; 
          I love that you say eerie because that&#146;s a feeling I often go after 
          in my work. There is something quite eerie about the way technology 
          can creep into the most private corners of our lives.<br>
        </p>
        <p>When I was pregnant, I had a sonogram picture of my son&#146;s face 
          sitting next to my keyboard. I used to look at it all the time and think 
          about how I&#146;m not supposed to see this yet. He seemed to have a 
          stunned expression, like I&#146;d disturbed him in this very private 
          moment&#151;floating in the womb. The picture is entirely black with 
          a glowing, skeletal face in the center, an alien in the oblivion before 
          birth. Think of that, technology lets us look into the oblivion and 
          how can we resist?<br>
        </p>
        <p>I&#146;ve been working on a piece that uses CAT scanned images of my 
          brain, mainly because I am so amazed by them. But also because it seems 
          like such an omniscient view&#151;into one&#146;s own brain. The problem 
          for me is&#151;how do I make something more compelling than a picture 
          of my unborn child or of my brain? It&#146;s very interesting really, 
          because none of the other artforms have this central problem.<br>
        </p>
        <p>We (multimedia artists) have this beast we are trying to ride which 
          exists as both scientific brilliance and as a giant clump of information 
          and quotidian communication (the internet, television, email). Additionally, 
          it has no artistic tradition and is constantly morphing into something 
          else. I think hybrid artists are drawn to this because it poses so many 
          interesting challenges and offers opportunities for self-definition 
          that are lacking in some of the more established artistic traditions. 
          And there are all these tools that are more or less un-tried by artists. 
          It&#146;s kind of a wild west.<a href="interview_p4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

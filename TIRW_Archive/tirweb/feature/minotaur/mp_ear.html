        Canto I: Ear</b>
		<p> White presents <i>The Minotaur Project</i> in four cantos, each of 
          which plays off of one of the human sensory modes. The first canto, 
          &#147;The Cartesian Chant of Making,&#148; addresses hearing, offering 
          a sound collage layered over verse text on top of a patchworked and 
          partially revealed graphical image of a human ear. Both sound and graphics 
          reveal themselves to the reader piecemeal in response to the motion 
          of the mouse. The verse text instead plays in lines across the page 
          from beginning to end in a steady loop until the reader chooses to close 
          the page or return to the main menu. The background graphic depicts 
          a human ear stitched onto a flesh-colored and yet inorganically-textured 
          ground, white stitch scars reminiscent of Frankenstein&#146;s creature. 
        <p>In the course of email correspondence about the piece White clarifies 
          my initial read of the image: what appear to be stitches are in fact 
          soldering marks on a circuit board, the ground into which she has integrated 
          the human ear, accomplishing the digital echo of Mary Shelley&#146;s 
          construction. The overlay of sound in Canto I consists of a set of binaries 
          narrated by an androgynous voice, sometimes more typically femininely 
          pitched, sometimes lower and more masculine. Quietly and insistently 
          it chants irony upon contradiction: &#147;I am code, I am chaos; I&#146;m 
          one, I&#146;m zero; I&#146;m man, I am machine; I am pattern, I am noise; 
          I am logic, I am intuition,&#148; and so on and on, a pair of incantatory 
          dyads corresponding to each of the 36 image tiles that make up the background 
          graphic. The only constant on the page is a central patch of 1s and 
          0s, representing, presumably, the binary substructure of computer code&#151; 
          &#147;constant&#148; in that the patch itself never disappears altogether, 
          but persists in internal flux, the 1s and 0s cycling like a machine 
          in process. <a href="mp_eye.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

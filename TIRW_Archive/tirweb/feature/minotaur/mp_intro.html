        <p><b>ARS&nbsp;RHETORICA</b><br>
          What I offer here is a literary &quot;close reading&quot; of a digital 
          text. By this I intend not only the recovery and reinvention of pragmatic 
          New Critical methods of reading displaced by subsequent trends in literary 
          theory, but also a more reflective application of scholarly tools to 
          &quot;new media works.&quot; The electronic piece I focus on here demands 
          just such particularized attention from its reader. <i>The Minotaur 
          Project</i> itself profitably retreads historical literary ground, weaving 
          familiar mythological and thematic material into an ingenius web of 
          signification. As a controlling principle, White engages a central dialectic: 
          between organic body and machine body, between self and creature, between 
          materiality and informational patterns. My work responds to her text 
          by way of traditional literary tools and, I hope, does the author's 
          work justice by considering the digital <i>as literature</i>. This entails 
          querying the text's material form along with its content, or what N. 
          Katherine Hayles terms its &quot;informational patterns.&quot; In the 
          end, my interest is as much pedagogical as it is critical. My larger 
          goal is toward teaching the text, toward the two-fold craft of reading 
          and writing in the hypermedia realm.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>INTRODUCTION OF THE TEXT</b><br>
          We commonly consider information abstract, quantifiable, and divorced 
          from matter, and in so doing privilege it above its material instantiation. 
          Media theorist N. Katherine Hayles critiques this trend in contemporary 
          thinking that splits information from its material context. According 
          to Hayles we see a dichotomy where we should instead see a productive 
          and intriguing dialectic.<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"

        <p>Kim White&#146;s <i><a href="http://www.home.earthlink.net/%7Etheminotaurproject/" target="new">The 
          Minotaur Project</a></i>, a finalist for the Electronic Literature Organization&#146;s 
          2001 poetry prize, innovatively explores this dialectic between materiality 
          and virtuality. Through the disembodied electronic medium White constructs 
          a patchwork portrait of her embodied self. Through the substantial matter 
          of words, images, and sounds she gives form to her most diaphanous thoughts 
          on identity. Through the trying-on of particular literary personae she 
          performs the transformations of craft. And through the materiality of 
          a poet&#146;s metaphors she revealingly engages an array of meanings 
          only indistinct and latent at the outset of the work.<br>
        </p>
        <p><i>The Minotaur Project</i>, as White describes it in the &#147;About&#148; 
          section, is the first installment of a larger &#147;hypermedia novel&#148; 
          in progress. In this first chapter White draws on classical mythology 
          in the tradition of Dante in his Divine Comedy and follows the Medieval 
          poet&#146;s formal precedent in offering up a series of verse-songs, 
          or &#147;cantos.&#148; Like Dante&#146;s poetic persona, White&#146;s 
          speaker ventures into an underworld, in her case a psychic one, through 
          the medium of verse. It is Dante&#146;s self-identification <i>as poet</i> 
          that inherits for him Virgil&#146;s stewardship through the Inferno&#146;s 
          darker reaches of the soul, and it is the device of art itself that 
          serves as vehicle for that journey: in the voicing of his cantos Dante 
          materially constructs the means of his journey. White&#146;s voyage 
          similarly maps its course via the technological media she employs. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The persona White identifies with in her work is the mythological Kore 
          or Persephone, daughter of Demeter the earth-mother, abducted to the 
          underworld by Hades as a young woman. The alternate creature she considers, 
          addresses, and sometimes speaks through in the poem&#146;s meditations 
          is that half-man half-beast of mythology, the Minotaur. In her contemplation, 
          this creature assumes a new hybridity: the cyborg notion of half-human/ 
          half-machine which the digital age considers with such fascination and 
          ambivalence. White combines separate yet thematically analogous elements 
          from mythology to attain her ends: the figure of Kore who travels to 
          a maze-like underworld and the figure of the Minotaur who inhabits an 
          underworldish Labyrinth. Her means of undertaking itself echoes its 
          subject matter, issuing her living voice through sound files and embodying 
          thought forms through animated text to produce a digitally constructed 
          collage of &#147;self&#148;: a new construction that is part-human and 
          part-digital, and, to her, reflective of the part-monstrous part-divine 
          identity in a digital age.<a href="mp_reading.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

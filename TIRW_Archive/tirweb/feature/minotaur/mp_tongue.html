          Canto III: Tongue</b>
		  <p>
          &#147;The Initial Diagnosis&#148; elaborates the examination references 
          of Canto II by outlining an array of phobia descriptions positioned 
          around the central graphic of a mouth saying &#147;Aaaaaahhh.&#148; 
          Phobias constitute the institutional classification and pathology of 
          human fear, once again discipline&#146;s interpolation of identity. 
          The phobias named in Canto III play off of the central image of the 
          mouth in a combination of visual and thematic ways. </p>
        <p>&#147;Autophobia&#148; or &#147;the fear of self, being oneself&#148; 
          keys off of the tongue&#146;s pink, offering an analysis in brief of 
          pink as synecdoche for female identity. </p>
        <p>&#147;Zone 2. Laliophobia (fear of speaking)&#148; dwells on the &#147;unfixedness&#148; 
          of speech, and by extension of language itself, a recurring anxiety 
          of those who write. </p>
        <p>&#147;Zone 3. Helminthophobia (fear of being infested with worms)&#148; 
          is preoccupied with issues of consumption and being consumed, a complex 
          subject for the producer of a text. </p>
        <p>&#147;Zone 4. Patriophobia (fear of heredity)&#148; plays with the 
          idea of an &#147;underground&#148; or &#147;belowground&#148;&#151;at 
          once the belly, the psyche, and Dante&#146;s underworld&#151;and the 
          questions of pregnancy in its many senses as a kind of colonization 
          where &#147;sockets&#148; serve as human expansion slots. </p>
        <p>Here, too, the technology White uses specifically constructs her composition&#146;s 
          meanings on several levels at once. Digital animation allows her to 
          foreground a play on the two senses of the homynym &#147;forbearing&#148; 
          / &#147;forebearing&#148;&#151; static text alone offers a limited means 
          for expressing this duality, most common in contemporary poetry the 
          use of brackets or parentheses to surround the pivotal &#147;e&#148;: 
          &#147;for(e)bearing.&#148; White&#146;s new media tools, however, allow 
          her to elaborate this dual meaning, giving it yet further dimensions 
          by causing the central &#147;e&#148; to tumble down the page out of 
          the graphic throat. It is the act of speech specifically in this instance 
          that accomplishes the transformation of emphasis from creation to endurance.<a href="mp_fingertip.html">&gt;&gt;</a>

        <p><b>PEDAGOGY: TOWARD READING</b></p>
        <p>As a literature that blends multiple &quot;literacies&quot; (visual, 
          media, and print-based/Literary, to name only the most obvious), hypermedia 
          works chart an aggressively exploratory course. In the process of such 
          innovation, the resulting text can present a formidable edifice. A matter 
          of some importance becomes: How do we read the hypermedia text? And, 
          perhaps even more poignantly, how, and <i>where</i>, do we teach it? 
          For my own pedagogical purposes, I propose for this hybrid form of writing 
          a hybrid classroom, combining diverse disciplinary tactics and skills: 
          the high-tech literary workshop. Although I don't believe in artificially 
          splitting reading from writing in the classroom, for the purposes of 
          clarity here I'll begin by addressing reading.</p>
        <p><b>The text that instructs</b></p>
        <p><b><img src="navel.jpg" width="315" height="235" align="right"><br>
          </b><i>The Minotaur Project</i> defies traditional linear readings&#151;not 
          only does the structure itself suggest traveling multiple possible paths, 
          but the &#147;content&#148; of the poem itself begins before the traditional 
          poetic &#147;stanzas&#148; do: the index page, an element unique to 
          electronic interfaces, is itself integral to the work&#146;s content, 
          delivering descriptive information even from the poem&#146;s outset. 
          The index page presents a visual field whose meanings are thematically 
          evocative if not specifically legible. </p>
        <p>Within a flesh-toned ground some central wound or orifice lies all 
          but concealed by the pattern of the gauze&#146;s weave. White reveals 
          in private correspondence that this central image is a human navel, 
          which further plays on notions of origination and identity, but even 
          without absolute certainty about the anatomy beneath the gauze, we can 
          read from the image the narrative and associative matter elaborated 
          elsewhere in the poem: a body in repair or transformation. Even prior 
          to the cantos themselves, the poet sets in motion with graphical imagery 
          the metaphors she&#146;ll be employing later. In this sense the digital 
          object transgresses the bounds of the &#147;poem&#148; as we might traditionally 
          conceive of it, and in these and other ways &#147;reading&#148; the 
          piece becomes a process that instructs as it evolves through execution.</p>
        <p><b>Crafting the reader</b><br>
          In order to yield most fully, a hypermedia text<i> </i>like Kim White's<i> 
          The Minotaur Project</i> demands from its reader a sustantial time commitment&#151;and 
          one we're perhaps unaccustomed to making in the realm of digital media. 
          Web use and electronic media more broadly are nothing if not defined 
          by speed and ease of consumption; simply cast a glance over the language 
          that predominates the field: the Information <i>Superhighway</i>, Macromedia 
          <i>Flash</i>, and so on. &quot;Digital&quot; to a contemporary audience 
          means hot, happening, <i>now</i>. At first glance, not the most conducive 
          conditions for the delayed gratification of a methodical approach. And 
          yet, hypermedia literature follows the precedent of its print-based 
          forbears in richness of rendering&#151;and hypermedia authors craft 
          for no one so much as an attentive audience. </p>
        <p>In addition to sustained attention, the hypermedia text demands from 
          its reader a certain flexibility of mind: the willingness to learn from 
          the text itself how best to read it. Unlike a paperbound volume, here 
          we're confronted with media that, to some extent at least, resist traditional 
          reading practices: they are dynamic, shifting; there is noise as well 
          as motion; even the text on the &quot;page&quot; does not stand still; 
          and more often than not the &quot;story&quot; is nonsequential. As an 
          avant-garde art form, this defiant stance is nothing new. Experimental 
          works in any medium construct their own modes and means of signifying 
          as they go. But the<i> avant-garde</i> implies an elite audience. For 
          those of us unwilling to relegate literature of any form to the fog 
          of obscurity, it behooves us to construct a tactical pedagogy: a system 
          of exploration and explication that strategically introduces&#151;but 
          does not reduce&#151;complex texts.</p>
        <p>Literary studies scholar Robert Scholes recommends such an approach 
          in his most recent volume, <i>The Crafty Reader<A HREF="footnotes.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','450','600','yes','left');return false"
                  onfocus="this.blur()">2</a>.</i> While he doesn't take up the 
          question of hypermedia works in particular, much of what he says about 
          the teaching of that other quite often arcane and hermetic genre, poetry, 
          applies just as well to digital texts. Scholes frames his argument within 
          the legacy of New Criticism, offering at once a critique and a suggestion 
          for use. In spite of the New Critics' belief in poetry's pinnacle importance 
          and their substantive contributions to reading practice, the New Critical 
          heritage, Scholes argues, has resulted in poetry's systematic and calcified 
          relegation to the cultual periphery in this country. </p>
        <p>In a word, Scholes identifies this alienation as resulting from the 
          production of <i>fear</i> in readers. Broadly, New Critical approaches 
          to the Literary outlined a system of <i>valuation</i> that manifested 
          in ferocious condemnation of works of insufficient rigor and &quot;taste&quot;&#151;a 
          taste, Scholes suggests, thinly veiling scorn for the popular, public, 
          and oftentimes more &quot;feminine&quot; forms of writing. In essence, 
          New Critical prose, in both critical publications and textbooks, tended 
          toward <i>correction</i> of bad taste. Beyond this qualitative influence, 
          Scholes notes, New Criticism also set in motion the use of a variety 
          of<i> analytical instruments</i> that served only to distance the text 
          from the reader; students, put on the spot to identify literary features 
          such as <i>theme</i> or <i>mode</i> or <i>irony</i>, were inevitably 
          distanced from the text. From a piece of communication, the literary 
          work was transformed into an academic object. The poem became the site 
          of uninspired inquiry, divorced from lived experience. </p>
        <p>Scholes suggests reviving the potential and remedying the ills of New 
          Critical approaches for contemporary readers. A New Critical <i>close 
          reading</i> can yield substantive benefits&#151;when coupled strategically 
          with an attention to <i>rhetorical purpose</i>. Beginning with an awareness 
          of who is speaking and to whom and to what purpose and in what context, 
          explicit textual understandings such as theme and irony emerge organically, 
          without the distancing that imposing definitional tools on the activity 
          of reading occasions. Instead we prompt students&#151;crafty readers&#151;to 
          approach texts first as human beings, bringing to bear the particular 
          genius for understanding situation and story unique to each. </p>
        <p>Last, but not least, comes a consideration of the <i>form</i> of the 
          text. Given a rhetorical groundwork, detailed scrutiny of the technical 
          aspects (linguistic, programmatic, graphical or otherwise) of a work 
          serve to root a broad-based understanding in specifics. In a medium 
          in which <i>techne</i> is particularly complex, experimental, and at 
          issue&#151;as in hypermedia works&#151;the diligent reader can hardly 
          justify neglecting such material examination. I, therefore, take Scholes' 
          caution to heart, particularly for teaching purposes: to leverage technical, 
          literary knowledge in service only of a more human, and humane, interaction 
          with a text as a form of communication crafted by a person.<a href="mp_writing.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

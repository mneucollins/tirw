        <p>For weeks he hacked so hard we couldn't understand much of what he 
          was saying. The cough had worsened in a small amount of time. Between 
          words he would launch into spasms, unleashing this deep, annoying, machine-gun 
          rattle&#151;sort of like the jittery backfire of the souped-up 67 Mustang 
          convertible he once stripped to its bare bones then rebuilt like a Level 
          One &quot;No glue necessary&quot; snap-assembly model. The thing I remember 
          about that car was it sitting in the drive way all the time with the 
          hood up, and him under it. No matter how many points and plugs he put 
          into her, the timing would slip. That Ford engine wouldn't hold a tune. 
          We couldn't drive to Stop n' Shop and back without the engine popping 
          and banging and half the time crapping out. I was eight or nine the 
          summer we owned it, half a lifetime ago, but I remembered the fights, 
          the all night screaming matches over the cost of that car.</p>
<p>When they admitted him straight into intensive care we all believed he was on his last leg. Two doctors confirmed it. They shoved in a couple of tubes, cranked up his morphine, handed mom a bunch of double talk. I felt for the man&#151;the shear embarrassment of it all. After a couple of visits I started wishing he'd just hurry up and go.</p>
<p>Then we each got the same idea, all about the same time . I brought him a stenographers pad and a pencil. Sissy brought him a Scuba diver's chalkboard with a grease-pencil on a string. And mom, the charge-card queen, she went all out&#151;she used her American Express to get him a Toshiba laptop so he could tap out whatever the hell he was trying to say.</p>
<p>Anyone with half a brain could see he liked the laptop best, but apparently he didn't want to offend any of us for a change, so depending on who was in the room he'd use their gift to communicate. If it was mom he'd angle the laptop so she could see the screen. In no time he had learned how to stylize the text so neither of them had to wear their glasses. For Sissy he'd scribble a big word or two on the tiny board (sometimes making a screeching-sound that sent shivers up your spine). He'd write HI and BYE and OK, or if he was feeling up to it HELLO and GOOD-BY and BETTER. Once he wrote FAREWELL which was a rotten stunt to pull, and on Sissy of all people, because she could never take his formality in any proportion.</p>
<p>Possibly he sensed her resentment at being invited back to watch him... expire. She was eighteen, divorced, living with a drummer, and noticeably pregnant, but I swear he did it because she had cut her hair.</p>
<p> On my nights, Tuesdays and Thursdays, (and on Sundays, if I had nothing better to do) we'd pass the pad between us. He'd jot down short sentences, hand them over; I'd make a reply and hand it back. Sometimes we played hang-man or tic-tac-toe. He didn't tell me anything new, which was no surprise, because he'd never said anything that I could relate to or rely on. At least nothing that didn't have something in essence to do with a combustion engine.</p>
<p>I thought of inquiring. I had my questions. I was sixteen, awkward and shy, afraid any day I'd have that nervous breakdown I sensed crawling around behind my eyes. But I knew how to formulate a question. Over the years I'd stored up a head full. But in the end I spared him those inquiries&#151;despite my curiosity no way was I going to be accused of interrogating a dying man. All total, there were 80 sheets on that pad. In our time together we filled up maybe twelve of them. And I wrote pretty big. As it turned out the laptop blew the pad and chalkboard ideas away. Once the<br>
morphine started playing havoc with his nervous system neither Sissy or me could make out a single letter anyway. His Gs looked like Ss and the Ts could have been Js or Xs or anything, really. Eventually all his words started running into one another and everything he wrote appeared like a cryptogram. Mostly I just held his hand which was an uncomfortable way to spend an evening.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the Toshiba none of us would have known his last request, which was that his ashes be tossed into the wind from a lighthouse on the northern tip of Block Island. I don't know what significance that had for the two of them or even if it had anything to do with her, but to make his presence known Mom brought along the laptop. We each took turns throwing a handful of his powdery remains from the railing, and when the last of him<br>
was gone she read us this:</p>
<p>WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly reduces Serious Risks to Your Health.<br>
All My Love, forever, Dad.</p>
        <p>Which must have been his idea of a joke, really, because none of us 
          had ever touched a cigarette, let alone smoked one, unless of course 
          you count the second-hand smoke we were required to breathe all the 
          years we'd told him he was killing himself. He'd quit for a short time, 
          the summer he owned the Mustang. Then he started right up again the 
          day after he sold her. I thought about the significance of that fact 
          on the ferry ride home, beneath a cold and brittle sun, while the wind 
          whipped Sissy's hair, and mom, bundled like an Eskimo, leaned dangerously 
          over the rail, ready to drop the Toshiba like an anchor. <img src="../../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

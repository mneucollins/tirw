<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>Inflat-o-scape is an experimental, multi-faceted 'view' of an urban information zone:  a merging of architectural structures, information technologies and inflatable forms.  Inspired by the disjuncture between the seamless, virtual and abstract promise of new technologies and my own lived experience in a vast, multi-faceted, and at turns an utopian and distopian metropolis like Los Angeles. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>My idea of an "inflat-o-scape" comes from the historic (visionary and failed) history of inflatable architecture;  the premise a "do-it-yourself";  something whose value is "inflated" or "full of hot air"; as well as the fantasy of an intangible, breathing mechanism -- our own unforeseen future of global networks, virtual iconographies, and micro-controlled spaces.</P>

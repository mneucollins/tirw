          TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMY, AND OTHER THINGS THAT GO BOOM&quot;</b></p>
        <p>Inflat-o-scape is an experimental, multi-faceted 'view' of an <br>
          urban information zone: a merging of architectural structures, information 
          technologies and inflatable forms. Inspired by the disjuncture between 
          the seamless, virtual and abstract promise of new technologies and my 
          own lived experience in a vast, multi-faceted, and at turns an utopian 
          and distopian metropolis like Los Angeles. </p>
        <p>Inflat-o-scape is organized into six related and overlapping areas:</p>
        <p>SPEECH - the speech bubble as it relates to digital technologies, collective 
          communications and boosterism as architecture.</p>
        <p>CLUSTERS - landscape as mapped by consumer trends and <br>
          marketing technologies, the bubble economy and inflation as a <br>
          crowd phenomenon.</p>
        <p>COMPRESSION - networks as cities, data transfer mechanics and the relationship 
          speed to time.</p>
        <p>PROGRESS - visionary and failed prototypes of inflatable architecture, 
          architectural experimentation and inter-related social utopias and disasters.</p>
        <p>SUBCONSCIOUS - breathing technologies, iconographies of weightlessness, 
          and gravity as collective space.</p>
        <p>APPENDAGE - temporal forms as architectural appendages, the progressive 
          ideal as globalized commodity, the collapsed and disposable object.</p>
        <p>Funded as an new media artist project by Creative Capital.</p>

<p><b><font size="1">An Interview with Margaret Stratton, page 2</font></b></p>
<p>I
met with Margaret Stratton in her Iowa City, Iowa, home on a bitter cold
January night. In the bungalow she shares with her partner, Meredith Field, she
sat on a 1940s couch salvaged from her parents’ home in Washington State.</p>
<p>I
had come in through the back door, by the kitchen, and as I pulled off boots, I
looked up at an enormous black and white image of a charred building.</p>
<p>&quot;That’s
Wesleyan College, here in Iowa,&quot; she said, spotting my gaze. &quot;Some disgruntled
student burnt down the music school. I’ve always liked what fires do: the
transformation and the inevitable gothic results.&quot; She smiled at me.</p>
<p>Her
living room is painted dark green, a shade, she tells me, selected after she
saw it used in a James Bond film. A string of chili pepper lights ropes around
the room. On the television, a new television show premiered: Shari Belafonte
and other B-team stars judging &quot;pet stars&quot; brought to the cameras by eager
owners. One of Stratton’s two Siamese cats slept atop the TV. &quot;Neither of my
cats will be on that show,&quot; she said. &quot;One is too smart and the other is too
dumb.&quot; The smart cat looked at her and she nodded. &quot;I’m right, aren’t I?&quot;</p>

<p>On
the floor, her most recent work was spread out. The series, all shot in Italy,
began with one trip in 2000 to Napoli, and continued during the
summer and autumn of 2002. She quoted Walter Benjamin while flipping through a
cream-colored box of over-sized black and white prints. &quot;History is a ruin,&quot;
and sipped a glass of chardonnay. At 49, she has received five National
Endowment for the Arts grants, in both photography and video, among other
awards, and has taught at the University of Iowa for 17 years. &quot;I studied in
Rome as an undergraduate and when I decided to start shooting in Naples in
2000, I started with trashed, abandoned convents and churches, and that evolved
into looking around catacombs. Which are unbelievably weird.&quot;</p>
<p>She
points to a photo of skulls and femur bones, a sort of human pagoda, close to
one-story in height. It looks like something the Khmer Rouge could have created
during their decimation of Cambodia. &quot;Around Napoli, the catacombs had been
carved from tufa —volcanic —rock. It’s soft and easy to work with; it also
makes for a very distinctive, more cathedral-like effect. In those days, the
early Christians could gain penance by being bone arrangers.&quot; She gazes at the
photos, then looks up at the television, where a dog walked on his hind legs.
&quot;That is so undignified.&quot;</p>
<p>* *

<p>Stratton
talks about how her work is essentially about transformation and the sublime —as well as her quest to make the perfect print. But as she gazes at sheets of
crystal-clear black and white images, fine detail radiant from corner to
corner, bones looking so real you want to brush volcanic dust from your hands,
she sighs. &quot;Who is going to want to buy these images?&quot;</p>
<p>It
is fundamental tension for Stratton, being a visual artist with a desire to see
her work in collections, on walls, in books. Her images are disturbing at
times, and speak to a battle for technical perfection many simply cannot
distinguish.</p>
<p>* *
*</p>
<p>Born
in Washington State to parents who migrated west —her mother from Fargo, North
Dakota, her father from Pennsylvania, she sees her art specifically informed by
the events of her childhood, specifically the institutionalization of her
mentally handicapped brother, Paul, and her mother’s fervent desire to see her
strikingly beautiful daughter become Miss America.</p>
<p>She
recalls in vivid detail when Paul was sent to Rainier Institute for the Mentally
Retarded. &quot;If you see photos of it, it reminds you of a 19<sup>th</sup> century
orphanage,&quot; she said. Inside, the huge dormitories were filled with children of
all ages, from infants to teenagers. After Paul was placed in the orphanage,
the family made monthly excursions to take him to lunch. Part of this routine
included stacks of new clothes, each piece with a hand-sewn label: Paul
Stratton. Yet when they arrived the following month, Paul’s closet would be
empty, all of his fine things offered by staff to other, less fortunate
children. <a href="interview3.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

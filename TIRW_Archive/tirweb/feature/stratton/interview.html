Stratton’s photography is not an invitation to revel in the lush experience of
humanity. Instead, Stratton pushes your eyes toward the dark alcoves, the
crumbling, stacked skulls, the collapsed ceiling, the angel gathering dust atop
a long-forgotten altar.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As Professor of Photography at the University of Iowa,
Stratton advises her students to create work that &quot;makes people want to keep
looking at it.&quot; As an artist, she seeks access to places most of us will never
actually see —locked catacombs in Southern Italy, aging, abandoned prison
cells littered with rusting bed frames and curling mattresses, the jagged metal
ectoskeleton that was once the World Trade Center.&#151;</p>
<p>For
some time, her mind was occupied by what remained of the Twin Towers in the
brief period after September 11 but before salvage crews leveled the site.</p>
<p>She
flew to New York in October, 2001, and hearing repeatedly &quot;no photos&quot; from
armed National Guardsmen, soldiers guarding the site, she found access through
a parking garage. So she rented a &quot;really long telephoto lens,&quot; then
took the Battery Park parking garage elevator to a top floor. Surrounded by
cars, covered in dust and ash, she notes, &quot;I knew no one was ever going to
claim those cars. And as I stood there, the sky behind me glowed with an eerie red hue, literally the color of blood.&quot; <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

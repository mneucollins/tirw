<p><b><font size="1">An Interview with Margaret Stratton, page 3</font></b></p>
<p>On
one visit, he had an enormous gash on his head where one of the other children
had hit him with a coffee mug. &quot;My parents presented this place as a really
exclusive, fancy place for mentally retarded kids. But it looked like something
else to me.&quot;</p>
<p>One
Halloween the family made the trek to find halls filled with twisted orange
crepe paper and excited children. &quot;Then the lights went out. There was a power
outage. Suddenly, it was a cacophony, screaming and wailing. I took my brother’s
hand and we stood still in the dark. When the lights came on, there were kids
beating their heads, throwing themselves, against the walls.&quot; This first-hand
witnessing of life behind the closed doors of Paul’s world began to train her
artist’s eye.</p>
<p>She
trained in photography at the University of New Mexico, then considered the
best photography program in the country. Part of her master’s degree
requirement was a written &quot;dissertation&quot; on photography. Stratton chose to look
at the history of allegory in photography and studied the work of Robert Frank,
who was awarded the first Guggenheim in photography. &quot;I found an article about
allegory in &quot;October&quot; magazine, and read every book he footnoted,&quot; she said. &quot;I
tried to prove that the medium is allegorical —it is always a reinterpretation
of sign and symbol.</p>
<p>&quot;Frank
would shoot in very low light,&quot; and, Stratton argues, &quot;the grain of the
photograph itself is a transmitter of the message of the photograph,&quot; which got
Stratton thinking about other optically oriented &quot;message givers. &quot;Frank’s
story is an interesting one,&quot; she added. &quot;</p>

<p>Her
work, which covers abandoned mental institutions as well as famed sites like
Alcatraz and Ellis Island, is essentially based on what abandoned structures
call to mind.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s
like being a kid and finding a deserted house in the woods —trespassing,
afraid, fascinated, dangerous, knowing it once had a life in it that no longer
exists.  I think these abandoned places
are ‘haunted’ by what has happened in them. 
There is some kind of reverberation, like the past itself is an allegory
of memory.&quot;  </p>
<p>But
Stratton is as interested in the technical side of her art as with the
individual compositions. &quot;For me, it’s about composing, correcting, figuring
out the light, everything has to be perfect. It is demanding, difficult. And so
am I.&quot; She sipped her wine. &quot;I mean, Jesus, some of the exposures are five
minutes long.&quot;</p>
<p>When
I looked through the images, glimpses of the project she calls &quot;Abandoned
Naples,&quot; I suddenly felt myself pulled centuries back.  but vivid and exhilarating, of the greatness
of place described in a series of isolated images, of the splendour of
once-great churches and now devastated catacombs and chapels —Napoli, Ellis
Island, Roma —of the whole world as it once was and the world that those places
had then created.</p>
<p>Ours
is a world now in turmoil; yet the tunnels into soft volcanic rock, the lines
of black eye sockets staring out from ancient skulls, as though waiting across
the years for me and only me to come and gaze back at them, tell another story.
The world is on fire, they whisper. And it has been for a long, long time. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

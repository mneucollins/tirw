            An Interview with Brian Kim Stefans by Giselle Beiguelman<br>
          </p>
          <p>On Monday, Oct. 28, 2002, 10:05 p.m, Brian Stefans wrote: &quot;Caught!

          <p>He had received a letter from the counsel to The New York Times Company, 
            the owner of <i>The New York Times</i> on the Web at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com</a>, 
            who alerted him:</p>
          <p><i>&quot;It has come to our attention that you have posted an altered 
            version of the home page of the September 24, 2002 edition of nytimes.com 
            at http://www/arras.net/blair_present-dossier.htm. While the page 
            reproduces the nytimes.com template, including the day's advertisements, 
            it replaces selected bylines and other features with content you have 
            supplied. Most significantly, you have substantially changed the lead 
            article to include long and rambling made-up quotes from British Prime 
            Mininster Tony Blair regarding the need to act against Iraq, under 
            the byline of Raoul Vaneigem.</i></p>
          <p><i>The editors at the Times appreciate a good parody and would not 
            take action against it. However, the subject matter of this particular

          <p>The event raised a debate at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ubuweb/" target="_blank">Ubuweb 
            list</a> where many of its members manifested their solidarity to 
            Brian Kim Stefans, congratulating him for being caught. The most important 
            objection to this position was:</p>
          <p><i>&quot;Why do all of you think Brian a hero just because he got 
            caught by the New York Times? Why is he to be congratulated that he 
            got served with a cease and desist letter. (&#133;)I think your reactions 
            are kneejerk and quite frankly, simplistic. What makes Brian heroic 
            is the great work he does, not the fact that he got caught doing it.&quot;</i> 
            (Kenneth Goldsmith, Oct. 29, 2002)</p>
          <p>Actually, what made Brian heroic by this time was not the fact he 
            received the letter from <i>The New York Times</i>, but the way the 
            affair mixed up with his artistic practices, pointing to some particularities 
            of digital art as a field where more and more the borders between 
            aesthetics, politics and editorial functions melt in order to constitute 
            a transdisciplinary everyday action and attitude.</p>
          <p>This was the point of departure of our conversation about artistic 
            options, models, styles, books, web sites, blogs, projects that involve 
            political issues and the role of the author today. <a href="2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

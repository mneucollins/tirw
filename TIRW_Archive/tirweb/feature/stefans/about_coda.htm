      <p>The final 12-poem sequence of &quot;Pasha Noise: life and contacts,&quot; 
        a long poem which was partly inspired by Ezra Pound's &quot;Hugh Selwyn 
        Mauberley: life and contacts,&quot; the poet's satirical &quot;farewell 
        to London,&quot; published in 1920. </p>
      <p>My &quot;Nineties&quot; is that of the &quot;new economy,&quot; my London 
        is New York City (particularly Williamsburg), my Lionel Johnson is Alan 
        Davies, and my haircuts not the pre-Raphaelite locks of a Dante Gabriel 
        Rosetti or Algernon Swinburne but the practical buzz-cut of, oh, Miles 
        Champion? John Cayley? Darren Wershler-Henry? </p>
      <p>The earlier part of the poem, written prior to 9/11, deals with more 
        narrative elements, and introduces characters such as Pasha Noise, Tepid 
        Ezine and HVA (Her Videoness Avatar). This latter section was written 
        after those events and thus occasionally evinces a more nostalgic tone.<i>

          <p><b>GB:</b> Did they influence your work? How?</p>
          <p><b>BS: </b>In general, any web art work that impresses me with its 
            simplicity and the profundity of its effects influences me, or at 
            least frightens me. I'm interested in some conceptual projects, like 
            the mouchette site, which is not quite &quot;simple&quot; (though 
            it has a conceptual cleanliness). However, that's generally the type 
            of thing I don't do, image laden stuff that tells a story. </p>
          <p>I'm less interested in projects that involve infiltrating listservs 
            and creating web avatar personas&#151;mez might be one of these, or 
            Alan Sondheim&#151;since they seem too overtly saturated by &quot;theory&quot; 
            (tugging on the aprons strings of deconstruction) and the writing 
            is usually less interesting than both what you find in books and what 
            you find on, say, <i>Dagmar Chili Pitas</i>. The surface effects can 
            be rich and, in a sense, &quot;timely,&quot; but the fact that digital 
            technology allows one an infinite repetition of effects is already 
            plainly visible in the movies and in electronic music. To make the 
            social component of this phenomenon visible&#151;to use that word 
            again&#151;needs to be explored in ways that involve idioms that are 
            engaging as reading. I guess I'm not convinced that this work is as 
            &quot;post-human&quot; as it claims to be&#151;humanistic frames are 
            still very present to me in the work, but are then never elaborated 
            into the &quot;social&quot;&#151;the &quot;real&quot; world, which 
            has been sacrificed for the solipsistic world (or metaphor) of circuit 
            boards. I could, of course, be looking for the wrong things in this 
            work, and I know I'm being unclear.</p>
          <p><img src="images/alpha.gif" width="220" height="130" align="left" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">Some 
            of my work is so obviously silly and absurd that I don't want to claim 
            they were influenced by anyone I admire, though I feel some old things, 
            like &quot;<a href="http://www.arras.net/ubu_set/alpha.htm" target="_blank">Alpha 
            Betty's Chronicles</a>,&quot; look pretty fresh to me today since 
            more writers have taken to the web and have begun to explore language 
            in a way that avoids the clean, sometimes vapid and commercial look 
            of people coming out of art schools. &quot;Alpha Betty's Chronicles&quot; 
            was influenced by a work by Charles Bernstein and Dante Piombino called 
            &quot;<a href="http://www.altx.com/ebr/ebr6/ebr6.htm" target="_blank">A 
            Mosaic for a Convergence</a>,&quot; which is a nice visual assay that 
            is exhaustive of several tasteless web effects. My Director &quot;eye 
            candy&quot; works are directly derivative of turux.org's stuff, and 
            I like to think that Finlay's Little Sparta and the Toronto Research 
            Group (Steven McCaffery and bpNichol) had some influence on &quot;Dreamlife.&quot;</p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> When and why did you get involved with hacktivist art? 
          </p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I had <a href="http://www.arras.net/vaneigem/" target="_blank">this 
            idea</a> of working with several people to create an entire <i>New 
            York Times</i> website that had every word of Rauol Vaneigem's <i>The 
            Revolution of Everyday Life </i>embedded in it somewhere. I was going 
            to try to get a friend of mine to create a Perl script such that, 
            every day, an entire mirror site of the Times would be created, but 
            with Vaneigem's text there amidst the ads and photographs. <i>The 
            Revolution of Everyday Life </i>provided much of the graffitti for 
            the May 68 revolutionaries in Paris, and I had been fascinated with 
            the idea of a book being broken up into its component sentences and 
            spray-painted on walls. I had been equating my own work with graffiti 
            for a while, if only because few of my web works seemed complete enough 
            to be anything suggesting a &quot;book&quot;&#151;they were all one-offs, 
            perhaps something more like mail art.</p>
          <p>I did a little test of how the <i>New York Times</i> / Vaneigem site 
            could look by downloading a page from the <i>Times</i> and replacing 
            the entire story with Vaneigem, but the result was very uninteresting. 
            It became more interesting when I replaced only the quotes, putting 
            Vaneigem's words in the mouths of Tony Blair and Senator Tom Daschle 
            among others, and edited the stories to be much shorter. It was really 
            provocative when the Iraqi representative to the UN was being figured 
            as Lautreamont, making a play on how even a diplomatic representative 
            in a suit and tie will be figured as the monstrous &quot;other&quot; 
            in a news story.</p>
          <p>I realized at this point that I could never automate such a project, 
            and that, at best, each page would have to be constructed painstakingly 
            and edited for effect. So I just started sending out the individual 
            pages as they were done. This isn't quite &quot;hacktivism&quot; I 
            think&#151;or is it? I didn't know the term existed before I did these. 
            As with most of my projects that involve political issues, I changed 
            modes when a particular milestone was reached&#151; depression setting 
            in&#151;in this case, the Senate vote to give Bush the green light 
            to go to war. A few months later, <i>Circulars</i> was created, with 
            an insignia taken from Guy Debord's map of Parisian flows, &quot;The 
            Naked City.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <b>GB:</b> What do you like most on the web and on print?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I love the way words look on a page, and generally am 
            under the impression that reading online is not terribly pleasant. 
            I like the edge of a book page and working with text that either honors 
            the border&#151; healthy book margins have a profound effect on me&#151; 
            or which works right up to the margins. I like that books decay over 
            time, and that books have tangible class associations&#151;think of 
            Jan Tschichold redesigning the typesetting for the Penguin paperback 
            series, the Utopian gesture of that impresses me. I especially like 
            older mass-produced books that were not set digitally.</p>
          <p>On the web, I like that all of my work is basically ending up in 
            a database, and can be accessed in a variety of ways. <a href="http://www.arras.net/weblog/" target="_blank">Free 
            Space Comix</a>, is like a big scrap book of things I'm interested 
            in&#151; I've never created a scrapbook in print, since I hate my 
            handwriting, and I don't like clutter in my small apartment. I like 
            color, and I like stealing texts and reworking them&#151; the web 
            is good for that. </p>
          <p>I haven't gotten to the point in which I could program an online 
            community but that I think is the ultimate thing&#151; to create a 
            culture of some sort (something like Craigslist, simple but thriving 
            as an expression of social desire, but of course not utilitarian). 
            I kind of think of <i>Circulars</i> as creating a culture, since I 
            bet a lot of poets don't read the sites I (and now Darren Wershler-Henry, 
            who has recently become a very active &quot;author&quot; on the site) 
            am stealing stories from but prefer them contextualized there. It 
            is a multi-authored, international blog, but again, it's not an art 
            project per se. Of course, &quot;I could never have done it with a 
            magazine,&quot; as they say&#151; the logic is all wrong. I liked 
            the way websites like <i>Circulars</i> and Vaneigem (or whitehouse.org 
            or the war editions of nationalphilistine.com) suddenly appear, like 
            a &quot;wildcat&quot; gesture, via spam flooding the inboxes of everyone 
            in someone's address book. <a href="5.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

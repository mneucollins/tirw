          <p><b>Brian K. Stefans:</b> I guess it all goes through the Situationists' 
            idea of detournement-collaging previously existing materials to create 
            objects with new meanings that deviate from those of the original. 
            It's also something like what I did on my project with Kim Rosenfield 
            &quot;<a href="http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/index.htm" target="_blank">The 
            Truth Interview</a>,&quot; for which I used her poems and &quot;star 
            profile&quot;-style responses to my questions, along with clippings 
            from magazines she had given me, and inserted them in the template 
            from the <i>National Inquirer</i> website, combining these with original 
            Flash applications and a soundtrack of her reading. All three projects 
            rely not just on appropriation, but on reconfiguring of the meaning 
            systems of other sites and cultural phenomena&#151;ads, stories, tones, 
            class identities, etc.&#151;for their effect.</p>
          <p>Basically, anything on the web is liable to collaged with something 
            else; any project such as this one, or the five pieces of the Vaneigem 
            series (I got my text of <i>The Revolution of Everyday Life</i> from 
            the web) could have been the result of a computer glitch accidentally 
            putting these texts and objects on the same web page (a Perl script 
            could have done this also). It's certainly more possible that quotes 
            from Rauol Vaneigem will end up in a<i> New York Times</i> web story 
            than it is that Don Quixote will be written the exact the same way, 
            word for word on two separate occasions by different authors (as Borges 
            suggests), or that monkeys will tap out Shakespeare on a typewriter. 
            My web projects &quot;force the hand of chance&quot; so to speak, 
            though of course the chance aspect was most satisfied with the arrival 
            of the email from Nancy Richman.</p>
          <p>I didn't write any of the text for these projects with the exception 
            of editorials for <i>Circulars</i> and the questions for Kim, but 
            it all falls directly in a line starting with the Dadaists and Surrealists, 
            which is this appeal to chance juxtapositions to create &quot;convulsive&quot; 
            effects (to echo Breton). <i>Circulars</i> is not intended to be an 
            artwork, at least in any strict sense (it's not a product or a performance), 
            but I suspect that its strength is in its verbal and visual choreography, 
            its skewed relationship to fact, and that it was produced by several 
            authors, rather than any individual piece of content. </p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> You, as many others in our field, mix the role of editor 
            with the artist practice and sometimes with e-business services and 
            political use of the web. Do you think this is inherent to our media 
            (the web)?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I don't think I've ever done anything that could be called 
            &quot;e-business&quot; though I do seem to be a kind of mini-me Silvio 
            Berlesconi by having everything online under the arras.net rubric&#151;the 
            various .pdfs on my site, the digital poetry, <i>Circulars</i>, etc. 
            I guess the fact that I determine the release dates of anything I 
            do, spam my friends and listservs, etc. does make it appear to be 
            a business&#151;there's certainly some sort of economy involved&#151;but 
            I've never sold anything, and have never been particularly intent 
            on tweaking web commerce in my work (outside of the commerce in news, 
            of course).</p>
          <p>I also don't think web work is inherently &quot;political&quot;&#151;to 
            ride on such a belief just leads to often lukewarm, incoherent postures, 
            the position of dissent through glitches, that I don't quite understand. 
            However, the web does seem the most obvious place to enact political 
            desire, to favor a political vision in public, and I don't want to 
            be prescriptive about how that's done. It's certainly quite easy to 
            steal anything from the web and integrate it into some other project, 
            theft itself being a political act, but one could then suggest that 
            all words are &quot;political&quot; because they can end up in a politicized 
            poem&#151;Kenneth Goldsmith's new book <i>Day</i> would then be political 
            art. Some writers would claim that, of course, but I tend to think 
            that, though the web is inherently social, political efficacy&#151;impossible 
            to measure, a holy grail of sorts&#151;would depend how specific one 
            is in deterritorializing or framing a work (including its plagiarisms) 
            in order to foreground its social mechanisms. </p>
          <p>I guess your question is whether a web artist has to wear many hats, 
            be a designer, etc. Certainly it helps. I programmed computers long 
            before I was a poet, but some artists thrive by commissioning work 
            from programmers, visual artists, etc. I find that one stumbles upon 
            more useful mistakes when doing the work oneself, though at some health 
            risks&#151;most of my projects ended when my cartilage just didn't 
            seem able to go on. There does seem to be some element of bureaucrat 
            involved in every web project, even one done solitarily, as there 
            are so many components that have to coordinated, none of which feed 
            directly from a moment of &quot;inspiration&quot; like in a lyric 
            poem&#151;hence, one is jumping around to different stations, from 
            computer to computer, having to brush up on the latest standards and 
            software , which all strikes me as unromantic and bureaucratic. <a href="3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

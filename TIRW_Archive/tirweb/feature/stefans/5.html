            What you can not stand on the web and on print?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I can't stand that my last book, <i>Angry Penguins</i>, 
            is still sitting in their boxes in my apartment, never to be sold 
            or even given away, and that my first book is collecting dust in the 
            basement of the Segue building. I can't stand that a power surge or 
            some sort of virus could eat up everything I've ever done on the web 
            so that it disappears from history, or that time itself will eventually 
            render all of my work unreadable in the future.</p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> Why does it annoy you so much? You seem to be so conscious 
            about the &quot;digital resistance&quot; to preservation (your grandson 
            will not be able to check your Flash 5 pieces)...</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I was being a little glib in those answers&#151; certainly, 
            those fears don't keep me up at night, but it sometimes does bother 
            me that the pieces will never make their presence known in the world 
            of objects, never break in a way that leaves trails on the ground 
            or which can be fixed by humans with crafty, careful hands. I do see 
            internet work as &quot;performance art&quot; in the sense that ephemerality 
            is built in to the entire practice&#151; some limited group of people 
            will experience and remember them, a bond or community could exist 
            around this memory&#151; but then again, it seems a waste to spend 
            so much time trying to get some dissolve to look just right, some 
            mouse action to flow smoothly, only to see it trashed with the new 
            release of a Flash player. All of the Java I wrote for my poems (like 
            &quot;Naif and the Bluebells&quot;) is garbage now.</p>
          <p>For the heck of it, I converted &quot;Dreamlife of Letters&quot; 
            to Quicktime recently and noticed that some of the best parts, like 
            the Oedipal &quot;o&quot; circle, didn't render properly at all. (In 
            fact, there was just a long stretch of blank orange screen, which 
            I hope would suggest to my future viewer that a plug-in failure was 
            occurring.) So were that to be the final version of the piece&#151;if, 
            for some reason, no one thought it necessary to create a dependable 
            Flash emulator&#151;then that key moment (well, <i>I</i> think it's 
            key) would be lost.</p>
          <p>There are, of course, many early films that we watch without having 
            any idea how they looked on fresh prints, running through period projectors, 
            and in the old theaters on small screens. One just hopes that the 
            style of decay of a digital art piece is as interesting to observe 
            as that of a piece of celluloid&#151; possible but not likely.). But 
            my sense is that, like with drama, one would only be able to appreciate 
            the work with some documentary description of what it looked like 
            on a small 17&quot; screen powered by some ancient hunk of junk called 
            a G4, just like we don't know how David Garrick acted on the 18th 
            century stage but he remains in the cultural memory (somewhere).</p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> &quot;The Dreamlife of Letters&quot; is very cinematic. 
            Are movies and television important for you.?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> Movies are, but not television. My list of favorite directors 
            is quite long, but on the top are Orson Welles, Jean Vigo, and Herzog 
            when he worked with Kinski, etc. I'm not sure that I use cinematic 
            techniques in my work unless it be what I've picked up from movie 
            titles&#151; this would be in &quot;The Dreamlife of Letters&quot;&#151; 
            but that certainly was not what I was trying to do.</p>
          <p>I've always thought Godard was a very important director for web 
            artists and poets to look at closely&#151; I write about this in &quot;Reflections 
            on Cyberpoetry,&quot; in which he becomes, indirectly, the Swinburne 
            of our age (though the Situationists, of course, pilloried him). I 
            think the greatest development has been, of course, the advent of 
            digital cinema&#151; the first two Dogma films, Russian Ark, that 
            kind of thing, blow my mind. </p>
          <p>I was a televisions junky when I was a kid&#151; I bought my first 
            computer after winning a television trivia contest sponsored by a 
            local newspaper&#151; so perhaps I have been influenced in that I 
            never want to be as passive a receptor as I was when I was a lonely 
            kid tethered to the set. There's only so long you can sit in a movie 
            theater.</p>
          <p><b>GB: </b>You have some collaborative pieces. Is your intention 
            to question the role of the author in your artistic work?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I guess I'm doing something like that, but I wouldn't 
            want to suggest that this is a parameter of the work worth paying 
            attention to. My sense is that many artists have gone on the record 
            as critiquing the notion of &quot;author&quot; but have more or less 
            become authors of some sort, or have fulfilled the &quot;author function&quot; 
            in some other way that rendered the initial motivation moot. The more 
            radical expressions of non-authorship&#151; some of these crazy blogs 
            that I've been coming across, for example, or the collaborative writings 
            of the SI&#151; are bound to remain obscure unless some scholar decides 
            to go on the trail and put the story back together, at which point 
            they enter a narrative of the author (the SI writings under the rubric 
            of Debord and Vaneigem, for instance). I just don't see how the author 
            is questioned so much anymore by collaborative works; the age of romantic 
            &quot;genius&quot; is long past us, now all there is left is money&#151; 
            you take or leave it, &quot;author&quot; or not. (Insert smiley emoticon 
            here.)</p>
          <p>The more interesting point is pseudonyms, avatar names, etc., but 
            even in this case the trail of cultural capital will find its source. 
            The only reason to really push a pseudonym (or many pseudonyms) is 
            if you are doing something illegal (most of us aren't) or if you are 
            mimicking a corporate model, like an artist's collective, which is 
            very interesting if there is a real collective going on, with all 
            of its attendant social aspects&#151; more than the negation of the 
            &quot;author,&quot; but the &quot;outing&quot; of social desire. In 
            this way, one participates as one does in a rock band, under a common 
            name that acquires capital in its own fashion. Artists can act like 
            hackers if they want to avoid being associated with common sources 
            of income and capital, but unlike hackers they don't have any real 
            control over the world's information networks, and, being vain like 
            most artists are, will have to conform somewhat in their behavior, 
            either by being comfortable with obscurity (and nurturing the hope 
            that history will vindicate them) or uncomfortable and hence self-promoting, 
            attending conferences, writing articles, applying for grants, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>Ok, I'm being glib again&#151; I'm actually not cynical. I would 
            love to do something more collaborative someday, indeed even form 
            a group. When I first started doing web projects, I didn't want to 
            sign my name to them even if I was the only creator involved. I invented 
            the name Reptilian Neolettrist Graphics for my credit in a book of 
            poetry by Stephen Rodefer that I designed a pseudo-Lettristic page 
            for. At this point I've collaborated with Kim Rosenfield, Darren Wershler-Henry, 
            Christian B&ouml;k and Dan Farrell (I set their books to the web), 
            and the other authors of <i>Circulars</i>. The more busy I get with 
            multiple projects, the less time I have to learn what needs to be 
            done, and I've learned through my (very modest) work in theater that 
            it's very fulfilling to work with people who are invested in a field 
            you will never yourself master. I'm not sure what kind of collaborative 
            work I would do in the future. It really depends on sharing a great 
            idea and being willing to nag each other to get it done. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

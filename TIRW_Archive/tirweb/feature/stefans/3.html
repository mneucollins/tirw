          <p><b>GB:</b> Let's go back to the beginning. When did you get involved 
            with web writing? Why?</p>
          <p><b>BS: </b>It's a probably oft-repeated story of being a grad student 
            (in English at the CUNY Graduate Center) in 1996 or so, having given 
            up computer for poetry in my teens, then discovering that there was 
            a huge interest in the humanities in computer technology but that 
            it all seemed pretty wrong-headed&#151;the claims for hypertext seemed 
            misguided or overstated to me. I knew I didn't want to be an academic, 
            and was very much involved in the NYC poetry scene, mostly with writers 
            of the &quot;Language&quot; ilk, an experimental American &quot;school&quot; 
            of poetry that started around the early seventies in the wake of Vietnam. 
            So it made much sense for me to try to reconcile my two lives at that 
            point, my past as a programmer and present as a poet.</p>
          <p>I was never much of a theorist (or at least don't feel a need to 
            conclusively map territories of possibilities prior to making art, 
            as much as I cherish ideas), so I just jumped right in, learned rudimentary 
            C++ , wrote some poems that way (I describe one in detail in <i>Fashionable 
            Noise</i>), then got on to the web with the first manifestation of 
            <a href="http://www.arras.net" target="_blank">arras.net</a>. Eventually 
            I picked up on Director and Flash etc. and got involved with people 
            like Kenneth Goldsmith, whose <a href="htto://www.ubu.com/" target="_blank">ubu.com</a> 
            was relatively young then though quite well-known and richly populated, 
            and later with the ubuweb listserv. Kenny&#151; who can have the air 
            of a NY gallery owner&#151; was a huge supporter of my work early 
            on and gave me a space to show prior to arras.net.</p>
          <p>I think the reason I went into digital poetry was the general belief 
            that artists are responsible for exploring new ways to experience 
            the world, that this is an exciting thing to do, that art must be 
            &quot;convulsive,&quot; not something settled. Artists must force 
            the paradigm shift, to put it a bit grandiosely. I was a big reader 
            of Ezra Pound when I was younger (though never bought the Chinese 
            ideogram argument); he placed a high value on the &quot;innovators&quot; 
            in poetic tradition, as opposed to the &quot;diluters&quot;&#151;yecch, 
            I didn't want to be one of those.</p>
          <p>I still believe that poets, especially when they're young, should 
            try to explore as many avenues of creativity as possible, if only 
            so that as they grow older and their insights, desires, etc. grow 
            more complicated there will be a larger set of tools available to 
            work with. This is my approach to poetry as well&#151; learn, even 
            master, the forms and rhythms, sestinas, sonnets, language-salads, 
            etc. since they'll come in handy someday even if useless for now. 
            Unfortunately, technology on the web turns over so frequently that 
            I can't imagine being a grandfather and trying to push out work on 
            Flash 5 with anyone being particularly interested, though of course 
            the Fisher Price pixelvision phenomenon (in which a discontinued toy 
            video camera became a fetish item among video makers because of its 
            quirky pictorial qualities) could be repeated in digital art. And 
            as jodi.org proves, yesterdays bit-map is today's fashion statement.</p>

          <p><b>GB:</b> Who are your favorite artists, poets and web artists?</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> Oh well... my favorite poets are numerous&#151;let's say 
            most of the major American Modernists (especially William Carlos Williams), 
            most writers associated with the &quot;New York School&quot; of poetry 
            (O'Hara and Ashbery), a handful of &quot;Language&quot; writers, poets 
            like Donne, Coleridge, Hopkins, Prynne, etc. And then of course my 
            too-many-to-name contemporaries who appear with frequency in my blog 
            and book reviews&#151;and those are just English language poets. I'm 
            not sure what Gerard Manley Hopkins had to do with &quot;<a href="http://www.arras.net/RNG/flash/dreamlife/dreamlife_index.html" target="_blank">The 
            Dreamlife of Letters</a>&quot;&#151;perhaps the reappearance of certain 
            shapes and gestures comprises the &quot;inscape&quot; of the piece&#151;but 
            I'm pretty sure that the next several years of my creative life will 
            be in reconciling my print poetic practices with what I do on the 
            web. Concrete poets who have worked in more conventional forms, such 
            as Ian Hamilton Finlay and Haroldo de Campos, are particularly helpful 
            in this case, as are artists like Tom Philips (creator of <i>The Humument</i>) 
            who work with text.</p>
          <p>As for web artists, I probably like most of what other people are 
            into: turux.org, jodi.org, jimpunk, Yong-Hae Chang, David Crawford, 
            all the soundtoy stuff (there's a piece called <a href="http://modifyme.com/" target="_blank">modifyme</a> 
            that I thought was brilliant when I first saw it), etc. I don't think 
            I've quite determined my own sense of the digital art &quot;tradition&quot; 
            but these are the groups and artists I respond to most directly. I 
            tend to champion a few less known folks like <a href="../poundstone03/index.html" target="_blank">William 
            Poundstone</a> and the people who contribute to <a href="http://bannerart.org" target="_blank">bannerart.org</a>. 
            I consider some of the new poetry blogs in the field of &quot;digital 
            poetry&quot; like those by Brandon Barr and Jordan Davis. In general, 
            I haven't been terribly impressed by the work of &quot;digital poets,&quot; 
            mostly because my standards are much higher for the field I am a part 
            of&#151;ditto for &quot;Asian American&quot; poetry. I tend to get 
            paranoid when I feel like I'm a cog in a culture of back-slapping, 
            which seems to me endemic in smaller art's cultures for which &quot;supportiveness&quot; 
            is standard of behavior, necessary as it is. All of these artists 
            appear on my <a href="http://www.arras.net/gallery.htm" target="_blank">arras.net 
            links page</a>, of course.</p>
          <p>I'm really into collecting &quot;tasteless&quot; political humor, 
            and am pretty convinced that most of the best &quot;art&quot; out 
            there is being put together by groups of deviant teenagers doing whippets 
            and just going at it on Director and Photoshop&#151;the same folks 
            who brought you &quot;All Your Base Are Belong to Us.&quot; The weirdest 
            thing I've come across is a blog called <i><a href="http://dagmar_chili.pitas.com/" target="_blank">Dagmar 
            Chili Pitas</a></i>, a crazy scramble of text and design that is very 
            astute literarily&#151;finding that was like stumbling upon a cross 
            between Henry Darger and Louis Zukofsky, and I wonder if I'll ever 
            find out who wrote that stuff. (Some is included in Arras 5; the author 
            chose to appear as &quot;Toadex Hobogrammathon,&quot; a name which 
            comes up 4 times in Google.) I'm also very interested in online programs 
            that translate texts into &quot;ebonics&quot; or pornography, etc., 
            like pornolize.com, mostly because it shows how technology just utterly 
            trashes any taboos and ethical safety nets and exposes social codes. 
            These sites make the &quot;simulacra&quot; of digital technology as 
            visible to the world as a (pardon the gruff imagery) dog turd on a 
            city street&#151;like &quot;a swoon that brings you to your senses,&quot; 
            to gnarl a phrase from Charles Bernstein. <a href="4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

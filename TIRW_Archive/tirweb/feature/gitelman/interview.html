          <p><b><img src="images/gitelman.jpg" width="160" height="230" align="left" alt="Lisa Gitelman">Matthew 
            Purdy:</b> My initial question is how the volume came to be in the 
            first place. Did you solicit articles? Did you put out a general call 
            for papers and then shape the volume based on the responses? Did you 
            have some idea of what kinds of media devices you wanted to include 
            in the volume? What was your initial vision of what you wanted the 
            volume to be, and did it change at all in the process of putting it 
            together?</p>
          <p><b>Lisa Gitelman:</b> I had the idea for the volume in 1999 because 
            I knew about 2 of the essays (Crain and Radick) and really liked the 
            way they went deep on media history in unusual (some would say oblique) 
            ways. When I got to Catholic in Fall 1999, Geoff came on board, and 
            we put together the rest of the volume using word-of-mouth, not a 
            general call for papers. We'd hear things at conferences and buttonhole 
            people. Geoff convinced Paul Young to contribute, because we knew 
            we wanted an early cinema piece. Throughout the process we were anxious 
            about the chronological and device-centered look of the thing, which 
            we saw as more of a convenience than anything else. We wanted to broaden 
            the conversation about new media and encourage inquiry into media 
            history. Part of that meant simply jimmying open &quot;media&quot; 
            as a category. To that end the little &quot;documents&quot; section 
            (which should have been better introduced in a headnote) was there 
            from the beginning, but the Press seemed uncertain about how to handle 
            it.</p>
          <p><b>MP:</b> Could you discuss how the volume &quot;jimmies open&quot; 
            the category of media?</p>
          <p><b>LG:</b> Well, without thinking a lot about it ahead of time, we 
            wanted to jimmy open the category of media in several different ways. 
            We wanted to gesture toward the range of sources available to study 
            and to think about (in classrooms, say) media history; hence, the 
            Documents section. We also wanted in those captions and in the collected 
            essays more broadly to gesture toward underlying themes like circulation, 
            inscription, and representation that so differently work to define 
            different communications media. Seeing themes like these in all of 
            their intricate variety&#151;as they pop up again and again in the 
            essays&#151;was one way to counteract the implications of a device-centered 
            account. Media devices make a handy way to anchor questions (and do 
            archival research) but we wanted all along to think through and to 
            get readers to think through new questions, new ways to ask about 
            media and media history.</p>
          <p><b>MP:</b> What are some of the themes you see recurring throughout 
            these essays? Do you see a kind of &quot;narrative&quot; emerge over 
            the course of the volume?</p>
          <p><b>LG:</b> I don't think I see any more narratives across the essays 
            than those outlined in the intro. There are lots of little threads 
            that appear and disappear, but certainly no over-arching tale of the 
            structural transformation of the public sphere, say. The threads I 
            like the best are the ones that address the discursive conditions 
            from which new media seem to arise&#151;the soil they grow in, the 
            rules we play by&#151;because new media get built into those conditions 
            so fast, becoming discursive themselves as they/if they succeed in 
            becoming transparent to any extent. So the book pushes beyond a predictable 
            critique of technological determinism or technophilia, I hope, and 
            gestures toward both the complexities and the *stakes* involved with 
            developing and deploying new media. Spiderman once said, &quot;No 
            one said changing the world was going to be easy.&quot;</p>
          <p><b>MP:</b> Could you go into some more detail about these smaller 
            threads? What do you think the volume has to say about how new media 
            develop? And what about the stakes involved in developing new media? 
            Has the volume succeeded in exploring this, in your opinion?</p>
          <p><b>LG:</b> I think the volume succeeds. It can't do everything, of 
            course. An enlarged edition would have to internationalize certainly&#133; 
            For now, it ends up being about Anglo-American culture in a pretty 
            parochial way.</p>
          <p>As to threads, I like all of the varied constructions of facticity 
            with which new media are engaged&#151; Enlightenment reason, science, 
            news, cultural authority, likeness, publics, texts. Those all seem 
            related to me. When I mentioned &quot;stakes&quot; (and Spiderman) 
            it's because I think that new media get so quickly built in to discursive 
            conditions from which they arise, like the operations of facticity&#151; 
            really a whole epistemology&#151; that we've got to be really careful 
            about them. We have to see them, how they take over for us and keep 
            us from making our own decisions about what counts and what doesn't. 
            Better, we simply have to see how they become disciplinary: like those 
            kids in the Crain essay performing with telegraphs. We are disciplined 
            by new media all the time, and yet we fail to notice. New media &quot;operationalize&quot; 
            (a horrible word I'm taking from Jonathan Sterne's new book, <i>Audible 
            Past</i>) the underlying rules we live by. The relevant rules preexist 
            each new medium, but media express and activate them. That's what 
            it looks like today anyway.</p>
          <p>I love some of the simpler threads too, the different construction 
            of the visual&#151;all those wacky claims for 3-D devices and other 
            &quot;real&quot; representations. Too, in my essay and a few of the 
            others there's the power of media that fail, as if the mere imagination 
            of new means of communication were enough to change the world&#133;

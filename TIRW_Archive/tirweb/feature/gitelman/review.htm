        <p><i><img src="images/newmedia_cvr.jpg" width="160" height="225" align="right">New 
          Media, 1740-1915 </i> traces a history of the dialogue between media 
          and society that has continued into the present. The title alone is 
          somewhat startling, pairing an emphatically contemporary coinage with 
          a time frame well before the dawn of modern technology as we've come 
          to think of it. But one of the goals of the volume is to establish a 
          context for our own notion of new media and how its newness is constructed. 
          The cover depicts the two halves of the title converging in a stereoscope, 
          a device that mapped two images over each other; the resulting third 
          image was both more palpably &quot;real&quot; than either of the two 
          flat images, yet ghostly, and all the more tantalizing for its elusiveness. 
          Just as the stereoscope brings together two separate images, so the 
          volume itself brings together the modern and the historical, along with 
          a number of other seemingly insoluble binaries. The authors demonstrate 
          how media articulates the zeitgeist that it simultaneously works to 
          change; it is both determined and determining. Likewise, though they 
          primarily focus on media technology, they inevitably consider media 
          content as well. It is impossible to completely divorce the causes from 
          the effects, the what from the how. Thus, this is not simply a chronicle 
          of technological change, but rather an examination of technology's uses 
          and meanings within society.</p>
        <p>The volume begins with the zograscope in 1740's England. The zograscope 
          had a convex lens that made it possible to view photographs three-dimensionally, 
          thereby transforming flat representations into &quot;spaces.&quot; Like 
          many of the authors in the volume, Erin C. Blake draws parallels between 
          the device's literal, practical functions and its more figurative social 
          repercussions. She argues that the zograscope could create a space removed 
          from a place, domesticating and, in some respects, replacing the original 
          physical place. One could then &quot;virtually&quot; tour the landmarks 
          of London without leaving home, and many did. In such a case, one encountered 
          an abstracted version of a place, stripped of history, politics and, 
          indeed, sensual experience. This, Blake argues, was particularly appealing 
          to the burgeoning middle class, for whom polite&#151; ie. emotionally 
          and politically neutral&#151; discourse was the common currency. &quot;Polite 
          society's&quot; attraction to the zograscope proceeded from an existing 
          set of values that the technology helped to bring into focus. Laura 
          Burd Schiavo's account of the aforementioned stereoscope's cultural 
          impact applies equally well to the zograscope. Schiavo calls the stereoscope 
          &quot;emblematic&quot; of &quot;a new, modern, subjective model of vision 
          [that] located sight in the interaction between the body and the outside 
          world, where clear distinctions between the interior and the exterior 
          were muddied.&quot; (120-121)</p>
          
        <p>This dialogic, reciprocal relationship between interior and exterior 
          runs throughout the volume's essays. The third chapter, by Patricia 
          Crain, discusses an attempt to regulate the interior through the exterior. 
          John Lancaster, an early nineteenth century American schoolmaster, developed 
          a system of education on the model of the factory, providing, in Crain's 
          words, &quot;wholesale acculturation and social control at discount 
          prices.&quot; (62) He accomplished this primarily through the use of 
          a telegraph that broadcast simple coded directions on reversible wooden 
          panels. The master and his telegraph were physically elevated above 
          the students, who sat at benches in the middle of the large barn-like 
          structure. Learning was rote and depersonalized. Disembodied, too, as 
          books were replaced by plaques affixed to the walls around which the 
          students gathered for recitations led by older students. Success&#151; 
          or, more to the point, survival&#151; in the school depended upon surrendering 
          to Lancaster's organizational structure and the telegraphic code at 
          the heart of it. The medium was the message in this factory-school.</p>
          <p>Lancaster saw the telegraph as a purely determining technology, yet 
            burgeoning communication technologies opened up new possibilities 
            for identity construction. Diane Zimmerman Umble describes the introduction 
            of the telephone into Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and the anxiety 
            it caused amongst the Amish community there. Keeping a telephone in 
            a personal residence represented an invasion of the outside world 
            into everyday life, and as such it threatened the identity of the 
            community, resulting in a deep and bitter schism between those who 
            embraced the new technology and those who considered it a &quot;sinful 
            network.&quot; Katherine Stubbs writes of a different response to 
            this unsettling of identity. Realizing how thoroughly an operators' 
            strike could paralyze the industry, telegraph giant Western Union 
            actively recruited female operators, as they felt women would be more 
            reliably compliant. Male operators responded to this perceived threat 
            in fictional pieces published in operator newspapers. These stories 
            portrayed women as deeply unreliable, abusing the power their new 
            public identity gave them. Female operators responded with fiction 
            of their own, most notably Ella Cheever Thayer's novel <i>Wired Love</i> 
            (1880), whose protagonist enlists the telegraph in the pursuit of 
            her beloved, only to find that, once she has gotten him, the telegraph 
            has become vitally entangled in the relationship. Even when they're 
            in the same room, they tap out sweet nothings to one another. We hardly 
            need Stubbs' suggestion to see the parallel between the telegraph 
            and the internet as sites of destabilized identity, especially as 
            it pertains to the erotic.</p>
          
        <p>Throughout the volume, we find the desire for authentic, objective 
          experience, which, paradoxically, seems to be only available through 
          the mediation of technology. Concurrent with this is an anxiety about 
          the body, or, more accurately, &quot;embodied-ness.&quot; Physicality 
          is aligned with authenticity, publicly verifiable experience. Two chapters 
          discuss &quot;embodied&quot; information with regard to the phonograph. 
          Lisa Gitelman describes the phonographic &quot;tours&quot; of the late 
          nineteenth century, in which itinerant performer-scientists played recordings 
          to audiences, with varying degrees of astonishment. A staple of these 
          shows was the recording of audience members themselves. The sounds were 
          recorded for playback on sheets of tinfoil, which were useless once 
          removed from the phonograph. Nonetheless, they became fetishized tokens 
          not only of the specific performance but also the process of stabilizing 
          sound in a physical form. This faith in information-as-object soon gained 
          scientific cachet through the efforts of R.L. Garner, a phonologist 
          who recorded chimpanzees in order to analyze &quot;the Simian tongue.&quot; 
          As Gregory Radick writes, this inquiry eventually took on imperialistic 
          overtones, as Garner sought to record &quot;the lowest specimens of 
          the human race&#151; the pygmies, the Bushmen.&quot; (187)</p>
          
        <p>The volume ends with two chapters that bring us closer to a world we 
          recognize more immediately as our own. Ellen Gruber Garvey describes 
          the phenomenon of scrapbook-making in the late nineteenth century. Printed 
          material of all sorts&#151; articles, poems, ads, sermons&#151; were 
          clipped from their original publications and placed in scrapbooks, much 
          the same way, Garvey argues, that web sites recirculate and recontextualize 
          information and media artifacts. And finally Paul Young writes on early 
          cinema's debt to the telegraph. By incorporating the telegraph into 
          the action of films, filmmakers discovered a new narrative vocabulary 
          that allowed for spatial and chronological jumps without breaking continuity. 
          It was the audience's familiarity with the established technology that 
          allowed for the new innovation, which consequently had a tremendous 
          impact on how the public saw the world. We thus end with a dialogic, 
          mutually determining relationship between technology and its users.</p>
          <p>All of the devices in <i>New Media, 1740-1915 </i> were new media 
            in their respective eras, and in a sense they are still new. They 
            are, as Gitelman and Pingree call them, &quot;dead media,&quot; media 
            no longer used and long since forgotten. These devices never got the 
            chance to become fully enmeshed in the fabric of everyday life; the 
            telegraph and phonograph evolved, the rest faded away. As such, they 
            appear to us today perpetually strange, embalmed in their own original 
            novelty. The volume's central lesson, then, is not to become blinded 
            by the promises of our own new media. Because it isn't new at all.

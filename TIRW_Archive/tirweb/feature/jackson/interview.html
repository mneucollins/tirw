            Bitch</a>,&quot;reads like an ode to hypertext, with its many almost-reverential 
            remarks on the form, particularly in contrast to print. You write: 
            &quot;in the no-place of hypertext, there's finally room to move around&quot;; 
            &quot;I adore the book, but I don't fit into it very well&quot;; &quot;A 
            conventional novel is a safe ride&quot;; &quot;Hypertext likes give 
            and take, snares and grottos, nets and knots&quot;; &quot;Hypertext, 
            then, is what literature has edited out: the feminine&quot;; &quot;Hypertext 
            is making possible a new kind of beauty, and creating the senses to 
            perceive it with.&quot; </p>
          <p>With these comments in mind, I would like to ask you to say something 
            about your forthcoming book, <i>The Melancholy of Anatomy</i>, specifically 
            with regard to the distinctions between analog and digital text, linear 
            text and hypertext. How do you understand hypertext vis-&agrave;-vis 
            print? Is it bound to a particular medium or is it a rhetorical mode 
            that can be produced by many different media? <br>
          </p>
          <p><b>Shelley Jackson:</b> In &quot;Stitch Bitch&quot; I was using &quot;the 
            book&quot; as shorthand for &quot;the mainstream novel&quot; (in its 
            most tasteful and predictable incarnation), and hypertext to mean 
            a rhetorical mode, which has had a long though not well publicized 
            history in print. Hypertext, as I was thinking it, embraces a whole 
            range of works, not just the most flagrantly experimental precursors 
            (Cortazar's read-by-numbers <i>Hopscotch</i>, Queneau's recombinant 
            <i> Cent Mille Milliards de Po&egrave;mes</i>, B.S. Johnson's shuffleable 
            <i>The Unfortunates</i>) but many more that have been subsumed into 
            the evolution of the novel, but whose lineage has gotten a little 
            lost among the hordes of identicals. </p>
          <p>I'm thinking of oddball books like <i>Tristram Shandy</i> or <i>Pale 
            Fire</i>, but also Joyce and Woolf and Stein, who are taught but not 
            much emulated, and all the prose experiments of poets, which are largely 
            read by other poets but by rights should send ripples through fiction 
            too, as well as many ostensibly non-literary works like personal dictionaries 
            and commonplace books. Hypertext--now in the limited sense of multilinear 
            electronic writing--seemed to me to give this variegated lineage a 
            fresh chance, because it makes a huge range of formal devices both 
            easy and natural.</p>
          <p><b>RR:</b> Your work has always seemed in some way to bridge the 
            realms of literature and criticism and its meta-critical aspects have 
            received a great deal of attention, but I wonder about another linking--between 
            art and programming. How do you understand the relations between &quot;technical&quot; 
            and &quot;creative&quot; work? How have you arrived at the point where 
            artistry and coding converge in a manner that suggests something beyond 
            basic application?</p>
          <p><b>SJ:</b> That's a funny question to ask me, because my programming 
            skills are minimal. But it's a good question, because I am fascinated 
            by the cross-fertilizations between form and content. When I first 
            started working in electronic media, the applications all seemed fraught 
            with metaphoric implications, which not only bled into the work I 
            was doing but inspired it. </p>
          <p>I wouldn't have written <i>Patchwork Girl</i> at all if I hadn't 
            been puzzling over hypertext in general, and I wouldn't have found 
            the graveyard and quilt metaphors I employed in that piece nearly 
            so ready to hand if I hadn't been using an application, Storyspace, 
            that involved moving little rectangles around inside bigger rectangles!</p>
          <p><b>RR:</b> <i>Patchwork Girl </i>is one of the classic works produced 
            with Storyspace, but I see that you have migrated to other production 
            environments. What have these new production environments and their 
            constraints made possible? Is there a sense in which your writing 
            (now incorporating text, image, motion) has altered in relation to 
            these different tools and the underlying code, the technological substrate 
            of the text? </p>
          <p><b>SJ:</b> I'm still interested in the possibilities of purely textual 
            invention in electronic media, but the web made me think about creating 
            works that moved much more fluidly between textual and visual material. 
            I don't think I've yet achieved the kind of gooey intermingling I've 
            envisioned; in <i>My Body</i> and <i>Doll Games</i> the text and visuals 
            are still compartmentalized. But I have other projects in mind that 
            would mix art forms very insistently, and then I think I would discover 
            that my writing had to be quite different-would have to cede much 
            more control to the images.</p>
          <p> When I first started writing hypertext I discovered that the link 
            was not neutral, but was itself a kind of argument, one that I should 
            not duplicate in my prose. I had to learn to allow the link to make 
            points that I would formerly have spelled out in words. In this sense, 
            programming is not just a substrate but an active part of the writing. 
            In a multimedia piece images also begin to do part of the &quot;writing&quot;--though 
            it would make as much sense to say writing does some of the imagining. 
            Mind you, this is not a new issue for me: as a children's book illustrator 
            with a wordy bent I'm always having to remind myself how much can 
            go unsaid.</p>
          
<p><b>RR:</b> In one interview about his own writing, Jacques Derrida<SUP><A href="#1">1</A></SUP> 
speaks about the monster as that which is Other, that which surprises and frightens 
us because it cannot be prepared for or known in advance: &quot;the notion of 
the monster is rather difficult to deal with, to get a hold on, to stabilize. 
A monster may be obviously a composite figure of heterogeneous organisms that 
are grafted onto each other. This graft, this hybridization, this composition 
that puts heterogeneous bodies together may be called a monster. This in fact 
happens in certain kinds of writing. At that moment, monstrosity may reveal or 
make one aware of what normality is&#133;.But as soon as one perceives a monster 
in a monster, one begins to domesticate it, one begins, because of the 'as such'--it 
is a monster <i>as</i> monster-to compare it to norms, to analyze it, consequently 
to master whatever could be terrifying in this figure of the monster&#133;.However 
monstrous events or texts may be, from the moment they enter into culture, the 
movement of acculturation, precisely, of domestication, of normalization has already 
begun.&quot; </p>
          <p> Derrida links the monster to a text that loses its monstrosity precisely 
            because it becomes assimilated or domesticated and thus loses its 
            power to rupture or disrupt norms, conventions, established ways of 
            seeing, and modes of knowledge. With respect to the figure of the 
            monster that permeates your work, and the connections you drawn between 
            the monster and your own writing, how is that a text may retain its 
            power as a monster, that is, its power to disrupt and resist domestication? 
            What role might electronic media play in this regard? </p>
          <p><b>SJ:</b> A radical text can't just depict monstrosity, but must 
            be itself monstrous. Oddly, I don't think that's too hard. All texts 
            are monstrous, really, always more chaotic and less coherent than 
            they pretend to be, but most writers smooth over the stitches that 
            hold them together. I think when you as a writer don't do this--when 
            you allow syntax to fracture, when you flaunt the bits you've cribbed 
            from other books and let them clash with other bits, when you create 
            unresolvable ambiguities or multiple solutions--the reader can't help 
            feeling piqued and disoriented. </p>
          <p>Sure, someone can write a thesis about &quot;disorientation&quot; 
            as the new literary value, and in this sense package it safely for 
            the world, but I believe the actual experience of disorientation is 
            still, well, disorienting. Electronic texts can be as predictable 
            as any others, but the medium can support really radical kinds of 
            indeterminacy--texts that attach themselves parasitically to other 
            texts, that morph over time, that invade non-literary parts of your 
            online reading, send you phony emails, or erase your hard drive. I'm 
            not saying they should, just that they could, and wouldn't that be 
            monstrous?</p>
          <p><b>RR:</b> The fantastic monsters and &quot;hideous progeny&quot; 
            in your work, particularly the game-based mutant dolls, led me to 
            consider your interest in prostheses and the constitutive elements 
            of the body in terms of genomics and cloning (since Doll Games and 
            <i>Patchwork Girl</i> certainly both give us alternative modes of 
            reproduction and regeneration). So, considering <i>Patchwork Girl</i>, 
            <i>Doll Games</i>, and <i>The Body</i> together raises the question 
            of the relationship of your work and thinking to ALife research, particularly 
            since your narrative environments, or ecosystems, often feature constructed 
            but complex and quasi-intelligent agents. </p>
          <p>Also, the thematization of the body in your work--particularly the 
            insistence on its materiality and matter that one can see in the various 
            prosthetics, dismembered limbs, and even the stain-suggests that you 
            might have some difficulty with conceiving of &quot;life&quot; purely 
            as &quot;information.&quot; Do you see your work in conversation with 
            ALife art? Do you conceive of it as participating in the evolving 
            discursive relationship between feminism and biology and in this sense 
            situated in opposition to what Donna Haraway and others have noted 
            as the masculinist bias of bioculture?</p>
          <p><b>SJ:</b> You say that my fascination with the materiality of the 
            body suggests that I don't conceive of life as information. I would 
            like to turn this thought back on itself and observe that I am obsessed 
            with conceiving of information as material. <i>The Melancholy of Anatomy</i> 
            is full of objects that are both things and nodes of information--phlegm 
            is reinvented as a kind of medium of human relationship, the egg as 
            an incarnation of the yearning for transcendent union.</p>
          <p> In fact I would say my whole book is a meditation on how and to 
            what extent one can find meaning in the physical world. (Though it 
            sounds pretty boring when I put it that way!) Whether one can think 
            through objects. Whether the world is not itself a kind of material 
            argument. I'm not a mystic, but my imagination is fired by, for example, 
            the alchemists, who believed that a chemical experiment could have 
            a spiritual solution, and vice versa--that the bible was also a lab 
            manual.</p>
          <p>My work is not a conscious gloss on AI, but I think I am asking similar 
            questions: what is individuality, what is will, what is intelligence? 
            What constitutes a person? I'm fascinated with undecideables, those 
            entities we see as both animate and inanimate: dolls, automata, wind-up 
            toys, primitive life forms. Certainly I'm partly exploring the existential 
            condition of the fictional character. But these preoccupations preceded 
            my identity as a writer.</p>
          <p><b>RR:</b> I am intrigued by the erotic fantasy worlds of <i>Patchwork 
            Girl</i> and <i>Doll Games</i>: in the former even intertextuality 
            is incestuous, and the games of the latter are really a kind of erotic 
            theater. Could you comment on the theater, game, and performance paradigms, 
            with respect to <i>Doll Games</i> and to electronic media more generally? 
            Also, what for you is the significance of ecstasy in the context of 
            information and techno-scientific culture? How would you position 
            your textual and corporeal eroticism--notably articulated in relation 
            to the past--vis-&agrave;-vis the medicalized and mediated bodies 
            and nightmarish futures of, for example, David Cronenberg and Peter 
            Greenaway? </p>
          <p><b>SJ:</b> My corporeal fantasies might look nightmarish, because 
            they are visceral and sometimes violent, but I would emphasize their 
            ecstatic elements. Like Cronenberg and Greenaway I do see ecstasy 
            as potentially destructive--there is a compulsive, self-obliterating 
            aspect to desire, which Freud would probably identify with the death 
            drive--but for me even this is worthy of celebration. In Cronenberg 
            the monstrous has a power to seduce its victims that destroys them 
            and people around them, but I think this is unnerving to behold precisely 
            because that seduction works on the viewer too. </p>
          
<p>I think eros can make use of the most seemingly inhuman aspects of techno-scientific 
culture, and that this does not represent alienation but the incredible power 
of desire to make the most unfamiliar material personal. People who fear the &quot;inhuman&quot; 
in technology should trust their imaginations a little more. Email is so sexy 
that one might fear it would replace sex itself were it not for the fact that 
it has led to so much of it! </p>

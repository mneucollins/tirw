<p><b>RF:</b>  So do you see a distinction between public and private worlds with the kinds of sounds you use?  Are these distinctions you try to break down?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:  </b>I am really interested in access actually.  Many of the projects I create I want to be open to as many people as possible.  I have taken very private moments from others, in using these phone calls, and also at other times with my own personal diaries.  </p>
<p>I created a performance work called &quot;Diary&quot; two years ago that took my very personal words to a wider audience for a temporary moment.  I think it's valuable to try to bridge a relationship between the author and the audience.  Even projects I'm working on now are exploring these positions.  Many public art commissions I create are actively offering an insight into these ideas.  It brings about an issue of responsibility that I think is very important.</p>
<p><b>RF:  </b>Does the idea of access ever impact where you choose to showcase your work?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  I'm more excited always about the chance of work being offered in an alternative space&#151;as far away as possible.  I am keen to work in new places, new locations.  That's why collaboration has always been so crucial to what I do.  It's a key opportunity to challenge myself and to work with a fresh perspective.  Having said that, I try to make works site specific, to reference the locale, to use the language, the accent, the familiar location but in a new way, to make the familiar fresh again.  'Sound Polaroids,' the project I travel with, does exactly this.  Capturing the images and sound locally and yet making even the familiar new, taking something very ordinary and making it extraordinary.</p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  I read that you chose the statement &quot;human kind is just a 12&quot;monitor&quot; to close the &quot;low membrane&quot; video because you believe that everything is dissolved into a screen and you're terrified that all we will have or be is a 12&quot; inch monitor.  </p>
<p>As someone who works with technology how do you see your artistic creations as fitting into this picture?  </p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  I have always been intrigued by the screen, you see... how we monitor our lives through it.  How you and I are talking here but we are also playing, we are acting in a way, too.  There is a theatre to these roles.  We consume theatre, information, news, music, so much through a 12&quot; monitor.  It can be addictive as you say.  As you clearly know I could be anyone here typing this to you.  </p>
<p>Trace [a British organization in support of digital work]is very interested in these ideas of MUDs and MOOs.  You know where you can occupy a space and imagine you are anyone or anything actually.  There has something amazingly liberating about new technology but I wonder...we have had no chance to explore how etiquette can adapt to this&#151;for example, the use of mobile phone technology, the invasion of others into your personal space.  The impossibility of silence or personal space and yet at the same time the ease with which we can close this off by simply hitting the 'POWER' key.</p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  So do you see your work as raising awareness about these issues&#151;socially commentary&#151;or something else altogether?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  I think it's important to consider these issues.  I would like the work to always be able to stand alone, to exist without any of these factors having to be explored.  I am uncomfortable with the notion at times of having to almost justify a work, yet I think it's invaluable to be able to talk about these issues.  I have always suggested that even if you don't like what I do, perhaps it opens up your imagination a little bit, poses a question you may never have considered and so on.  </p>
<p>I know that many of works make people 'uncomfortable' but without doubt the work of others that inspires me and entertains me even has an awkwardness about it, a darkness perhaps.  I like the idea of taking a person into a place that can even if only temporarily alter their consciousness I suppose, to offer the chance to question, to colour.  I certainly never sit down and create music and think &quot;gosh, I'd better make this the most disturbing piece I've ever written.&quot;  I just think I'm very good at writing positive music in a traditional way.  I grew up listening equally to John Cage, Throbbing Gristle, King Crimson, Brian Eno and Supertramp, The Eagles, ElO, Gary Glitter and church music.  Something about the melancholia always appealed to me in the best aspects of all this music.  The mood has always been important.</p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  Recently you have turned to working with images.  What prompted this move from dialogue to images?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  I still use sound obviously and have very consciously avoided the use of images.  As we are such an image-led society, we are incredibly literate in recognising visual culture yet so far behind with sound.  </p>
<p>Consider Hollywood where the history of cinema is also the history of sound design yet the role of this artist is always tucked at the closing credits yet their work shapes the image we are consuming.  </p>
<p>The images I like to use are often very mundane, relating to a city or a place where I am working or in the case of some commissions&#133;very simple objects referenced in a complex way.  For example the work The Collector shown in the Sonic Boom exposition in London back in 2000 was a work that used around 1000 photographs of butterflies&#151;all static, all dead, pinned to a wooden board in a museum, but I was interested in juxtaposing them into a sequence.  The variety of colours and shapes created an alternative rhythm and pulse to the sound I used&#151;which was a highly amplified recording of butterfly wings.  I am just cautious about people being too seduced by an image in a live performance context, so I rarely use images in live performances. <a href="interview3.html">&gt;&gt;</a><br>

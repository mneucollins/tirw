A new sound work for the cinema  </b></p>
<p align="left">Your chance to hear The Sixth Shining Wizard Sense, Bill and Ted's Alien Apocalypse, A Clockwork Bladerunner and 2001: An Aladdin Odyssey. </p>
<p align="left">Played on rotation between film screenings at the cinema was a new work of sound art created by Scanner during an artists residency at Reading College, England. </p>
<p align="left">Working in collaboration with students from the Music Technology Department, Scanner created new stories and films of fancy using a collage of fragments from film dialogue mixed with imaginary soundtracks. </p>
<p align="left">Scanner says of &quot;Listening at the Pictures&quot;: &quot;I wished to develop something innovative off-site, a work that was very public and yet could also include contributions from the students. I began thinking about a place that brought different groups of people together, somewhere intimate and quiet, that could enhance any experience of listening and chanced upon the idea of using a local cinema as a possible venue. The venue itself was the catalyst for the final work 'conscious that we hear films as much as we see them.'&quot; </p>
<p align="left"> &quot;Listening at the Pictures&quot; was commissioned by Art at the Centre, Reading in partnership with Reading College and was originally presented in collaboration with Warner Village Cinemas. </p>

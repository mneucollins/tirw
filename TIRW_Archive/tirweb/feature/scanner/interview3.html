<p><b>RF:</b>  What about taking sound from pictures?  I read about the recently developed software that you are using to do this&#151;&quot;scanning&quot; in this sense.</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  Yes.  It's not an answer by any means but a chance to explore the possibilities&#133; where the pixels become the tool brush with which to create the sound.  The idea conceptually is beautiful.  It still has a long way to go but it's certainly offering a means to almost paint with sound. </p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  Any current projects you would like to speak about?  Directions you see yourself heading in?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  Interestingly for me, my projects are never predictable.  They range from the bereavement suite in Garches hospital in Paris where I am creating a soundtrack for the mortuary room to this public art commission in Belfast where I am creating a carpeted space filled with around 25,000 deep blue latex balloons in an immersive work called 'Into the Blue'.  </p>
<p>At the same time I am constantly traveling, creating my own live shows, launching a project with the British School of Art at Rome called 52 Spaces, continuing to work with the Random Dance Company in the UK, collaborating with a designer Tonne in the UK, with Kim Cascone in the USA, bringing out the Godard commission of Aphaville 2002 to Montreal and LA and too many other things at the moment.  In terms of direction I just simply don't intend to have one.  I like the shape of my life in that sense.  Rarely a chance to be bored, unless an airline lets me down and leaves me stranded in a terminal for 15 hours as just happened last week on the way to Italy!</p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  I thought the performance you constructed using the look-a-likes was fascinating.  What prompted this project?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  The look-a-likes was very amusing I must say.  It's a funny story really.  I was interested in the work of Bruce Connor. He is an American artist who had a retrospective over at the Walker Arts Centre in Minneapolis recently.  He's from the 1960s.  He created films, even for bands like the Talking Heads later on using mostly collage techniques.  Anyhow he was offered the chance of being in an art dictionary and when they made a request for a photo he simply sent a picture of a friend along and told them he was 'deceased'!!  </p>
<p>He played with the scene and at the same time made the most beautiful assemblages.  So I was actually moving home 4 years ago&#151;the traditional route an artist makes when releasing a CD is to release product/make interviews/tour and I was never interested in this system&#133; and anyhow was very occupied with cardboard boxes at the time so I was speaking to a friend in Miami who (poor soul) looks unnervingly like me and playfully suggested that he play a show for me there as he was so often asked by people at clubs and so on if he 'Scanner' was playing somewhere!  </p>
<p>Then I conjured up this concept of having 16 parties in 16 cities on a Wednesday night in May 1999 to promote my CD 'lauwarm instrumentals' which in its own way was amusing as the title means 'lukewarm' but I had to change it as I had too many complaints from distributors in the USA that it was too 'negative' a title! </p>
<p>So I just changed it to the Dutch/German equivalent which everyone then loved and had to ask me 'what does this mean?'  So then these parties happened where I produced 16 x 60 min CDs for each local look-a-like to use at the shows.  No one was charged entry so in a sense it played with the facelessness of electronica at the same time. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

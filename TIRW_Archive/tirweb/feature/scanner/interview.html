<p align="left"><i>England-based musician, artist and minimalist anti-hero: Scanner aka Robin Rimbaud.  His eclectic mix of activities place him at the crossroads of academic and pop culture.</i></p>
<p><i>His controversial early work used scanned mobile phone conversations which he wove into soundscapes, but more recently his focus has shifted to trawling the hidden noise of the modern metropolis. In addition to producing compositions and audio CDs, his diverse body of work includes soundtracks for films, performances, radio, and site-specific intermedia installations. He has performed in and created works for many prestigious spaces, including San Francisco MOMA (USA), Hayward Gallery (London), Pompidou Centre (Paris), Tate Modern (London) and the Modern Museum (Stockholm).</i></p>
<p><i>His work has won admiration from Stockhausen and Bjork, and in recent years he has worked with Laurie Anderson, DJ Spooky, Derek Jarman, Michael Nyman and Bryan Ferry.</i></p>
<p><i>The following was a live internet chat, resulting in an interview, conducted in August 2002. Errors in typing and breaks in thought have been left as they were captured in the transcript of the session. </i></p>
<p><b>Rebekah Farrugia:</b>  Some of the pages on <a href="http://www.scanner.com/" target="_blank">scanner.com</a> remind me of what some are calling &quot;digital poetry.&quot; Was this intentional?  </p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  Interestingly enough I studied literature at university.  So language and narrative have always been of interest.  The work was also a reaction against full-colour-explosive-ego-boosting web pages&#133;</p>
<p><b>RF:</b>  How do you envision the relationship between language and sound?  In other words, what do you see as the relationship between language as language (in the traditional sense) and language as sound (as used in your musical compositions)?</p>
<p><b>Scanner:</b>  Experimental literature was really the first kick for me and still acts as an inspiration.  I frequently look at <a href="http://www.ubuweb.com/" target="_blank">ubuweb.com</a> for new work.  Language as pure sound has always intrigued me, too, even when I was simply using the scanner device to pick up indiscriminate voices from the ether in languages I didn't even understand.  It still meant that I could follow the &quot;colour&quot; of the conversation in some manner.  I could use them texturally.  It's curious today, too, that I make a lot of work for radio broadcast, particularly the BBC here.  I create documentaries that take a traditional form of question/answer and twist them in rather unconventional ways. <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">01 Last Tuesday the flies descended
      upon us, nipping at the sweat that seeped from our arms and necks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">02 It was a bad omen, the flies.
      It told us that the rains were coming sooner than usual.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">03 The corn hadn't even made
      yet, and now the fertile dust that floated from tassel to tassel,
      mating plant to plant, would dampen and do no good for the crop.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">04 For so long we've been waiting
      to suck the fresh, sweet flesh of new kernels. Now, we'd be forced
      to subsist on the meal from last year's corn whose taste has
      already grown stale. <BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">05 Theo gets sulky just before
      the rains come.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">06 Three days ago he left for
      the city. <BR>
      There, he claims, the fury of the insects and the weight of the
      humidity do not torment him. <BR>
      He sits on sheltered porches of caf&eacute;s&mdash;fans rattling
      overhead&mdash;swilling beer after beer until he's so numbed
      by the noise and the alcohol that the itching of the bites he
      endured at home ceases to bother him.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">07 Me. Ha!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">08 Me, he leaves to the fields
      and flies and my own fallow heart, which grows more empty and
      dangerous each day because no feelings are left to dust it with
      tenderness. <BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">09 But I have grown bolder this
      time that Theo's been gone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10 Before when he'd desert me
      for his precious city, his freedom, his beer-soaked porches,
      I'd been careful not to let him know of my own feats of liberation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">11 Alexander's innocence distracts
      me, and the fact that he can't hear and he can't speak makes
      our liaison seem, well, all the more discrete. For my generosity,
      he is grateful, and he caters to me like the faithful servant
      that he is.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">12 But never would I mistake
      our passion for love or his kindness for tenderness.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">13 No. We simply rub body against
      body in the stark damp sheets of my bed. But whereas before I
      would take caution not to show any affection for Alexander in
      front of the other workers, now I lavish attention on him, keeping
      him close to me and my chores. And in the past I would worry
      if any evidence of my activities would be discovered; now, I
      flaunt wine bottles we empty, lining them up one by one along
      the window ledge.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">14 Theo would have to be blind
      not to notice what I've done this time while he was away.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">15 But that's his problem and
      my curse: He wouldn't notice. Not in the least would he see what
      I have been up to. <BR>
<BR>
      16 The bottles could be stacked end to end, on every windowsill
      in the entire house and he would not see them&mdash;would
      not understand what I do when he deserts me, what I have been
      doing every day these past few days while he's been gone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">17 Ruthless and rough he is to
      all of our men, getting himself all worked up over a poorly dug
      fence hole or a cow badly delivered of her calf, frothing like
      beer foam at any man who speaks impudently to him.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">18 But for me, he has nothing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">19 Some people say I'm lucky
      to be a wife to a man who never beats her. But I say a greater
      pain comes from not being touched at all.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">20 This is my problem and his
      curse.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">21 So I twirl Alexander's newly
      forming mustache and tease the curl out of his hair and spend
      these days slapping flies and pushing through the cornfields
      with him, rubbing tassel against tassel, trying to get the corn
      to come before the rains wash us all away.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">22 The men in the worker's quarters
      didn't seem to care when they saw Alexander following me into
      the house this evening.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">23 At dusk they gathered on their
      broken-down stoops, fanning themselves and singing some of the
      songs of their fathers. The melodies they made wafted over the
      melon patch that separates them and us, and entered into my bedroom
      while Alexander and I made the sweat of our bodies flow like
      rivers and the flies drown in the tears of my cries.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">24 We drifted along for hours
      on the dampness, buoyed by the men's serenade and Alexander's
      lingering youth. Not even Theo's heavy step or his bellowing
      at my name or his long pained moan brought us outside of our
      dank bed of dreams.<BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <DL>
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Section 5</FONT></B>
      </DL>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">25 When I did finally feel Theo
      near, it was his fist against my cheek. And I did what any woman
      would have done under the circumstance&mdash;I pushed away
      from Alexander and claimed my side of the bed alone to meet Theo's
      flesh to my own, letting him assault me with his fury. And I
      began to laugh.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">26 With each blow I howled hysterically,
      screaming insults at him, taunting him like I always do about
      his unmanliness.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">27 His bulk gorged with beer
      and bragging could not suck anymore out of me than the tiny bit
      of blood that oozed from my lip. What blood did gush was my own
      woman's blood that flowed month after month, year after year,
      for these twenty-three years with no break, with no child to
      show for all the pain and fluid&shy;&shy;the very proof that
      Theo was no man, was no husband, but a soldered off old bull
      good only for pulling the plow and teasing the cows to distraction.<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Section 6</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">28 So I laid there laughing and
      laughing, until I took pity on Theo and kicked him in the groin.
      When he doubled over and moaned once again, I scrambled out of
      bed and fled toward the fields.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">29 Sweat and blood followed me
      into the corn, and I brushed past the rows and rows of fruitless
      stalks, feeling almost at once the patter of rain upon my head
      and shoulders.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">30 I laid down between the rows
      of the growing mud and wept for Theo. I wept for the shallow
      bed of dust and vegetation we had called our home. But most of
      all, I wept because I bled the blood of a fallow field. </FONT></P>

Jerry, this afternoon in Dorothy and Sid's gallery
I spent a long time playing with an interactive video.
It was as if the camera
was an extension of the artist's hand recording the scenery:
a mountain cabin, wild flowers, people,
a path up the mountain, a meadow.
The narrative was layered, complex, disjointed.
it changed as I explored the work.
<P>  
I had an idea -- of doing something like that interactive video,
only with drawing, 
drawing the environment so that the viewer 
stepped into a changeable scene
where each choice brought up another detailed drawing.
<P>
I was thinking that if you clicked on a tree, it would take you
deeper into the woods.
There would be an inviting place to sit down.
Pine needles, ferns,
sunlight filtered through the branches of the trees.
<P>
I imagined creating the woods in such a way
that the viewer would want to be there,
not photorealistic but dense,
each individual pine needle carefully drawn.
<P>
Jerry, I was in the mountains last weekend.
The aspen leaves were turning yellow, and I thought:
I want to come home.

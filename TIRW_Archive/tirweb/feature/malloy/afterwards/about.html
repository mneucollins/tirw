In a series of
conversations and parallel thoughts,
<i>Afterwards</i> chronicles the relationships of three couples: the young couple Tina and Jerry, who are
unsure whether to begin a serious relationship; Gunter and Gwen, who in
their lives have at times between unable to separate reality from virtual
reality; and Dorothy and Sid, who took decades to commit to each other and
now are learning how to live together.
<P>
<i>Afterwards</i> immediately follows <A HREF="http://www.judymalloy.net/party/begin.html" target="_top">    
<i>A Party at Silver Beach</i></A>. In a time of global turmoil,
it is a "musical comedy" encore to the cyber-epic 
<i>Dorothy and Sid</i> that began with the hypernarrative

<P>

Those readers who wish to follow one couple should click on one color of
squares in the interface, (an interface approach I first encountered in
Cathy Marshall's work at Xerox PARC). Those who wish to weave together
all three developing relationships should click on any square in the
interface. Links bordered in blue have not been read. (note that in
some browsers, it may take a while for the blue border to change. The couples'
conversations also appear slowly.)
<P>
The work is multi-sequential in that the beginning is accessed
at the top of the array, and the end of the array offers closure.

<P> 
The structure is somewhat similar to the narrative data structure  
I used in <i>Wasting Time</i> -- which over ten years ago used slowly 
appearing text to simulate conversation and connected columns of words
to simulate parallel thought patterns. (and was published in <i>After
the Book (Perforations 3)</i> Summer, 1992.)

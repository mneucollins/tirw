Gwen, I want to tell you what happened<BR>
but it is not easy to explain.<BR>
I was in town.  It was Spring, and I felt free.<BR> 
Remember, it had been a long Winter.<BR>  
I went to the pub.<BR>  
The one with tables overlooking the river<BR> 
where we always went.<BR> 
I was drinking a beer by myself.<BR>  
A woman came over to my table<BR> 
and sat down.<BR> 
She said she needed a ride to San Francisco.

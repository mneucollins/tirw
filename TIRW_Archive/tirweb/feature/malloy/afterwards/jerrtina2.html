All I had to do was see her. Every resolve  
I had is gone.  That's part of what scares me.  
It isn't only that I was worried about my Mom.  
This thing with Tina turned serious so quickly.  
The first time I have ever felt this way. As  
if things were exactly right.  
<P>  
But I'm not sure that's what I want now.  
It was fun to go out with different girls  
...women... not worry if and when I saw them again.  
Not be distracted from my studies thinking about them.  
Not missing them the way I miss Tina when she is gone.  
<P>  
I've been thinking about environmental science.   
That I might want to change my major.  
Haven't told her. It's a long haul.  I really don't want  
to be tied down.    
<P>  
And yet when I'm with her...

I guess I should tell him   
that I'm thinking of transferring  
to art school in the Bay area.  
But I don't want him to think I'm  
chasing after him.  It isn't   
why I'm doing it.  The artists  
I've met through Dorothy are   
so different.  
Art the center of their lives.  
That's what I want.  
Dorothy said other things are important  
and to think about it carefully,  
that there was time enough for that later.  
Not sure,  
and also not sure how much Jerry..  
how I feel about him..  
is affecting what I want to do,  
but I can't talk to him about it.  
He doesn't want to talk about our future.  
As if we don't have one.<BR>  
Or he isn't ready to   
think about it.  
Maybe my Mom is right.  
If I can't talk to him,  
there isn't much of a basis   
for a relationship.

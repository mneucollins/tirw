How to tell her?<BR>
I was in town in late Spring.<BR>
Having a beer.  
Met a woman, and she said<BR> 
she needed a ride to San Francisco.<BR> 
She was a painter.<BR>  
I told her about my work,<BR>
and she was very interested.<BR>  
Said she knew a dealer who would look at it.<BR>  
Maybe give me a show.<BR>
She was pretty and so different from Gwen.<BR>  
Sophisticated. <BR>
It had been a long winter.
<P>
I went home. Packed my things<BR>
and left with that woman for San Francisco.
<P>
I got a studio in the East Bay.<BR> 
Shared with a couple of guys.<BR>  
It was so different.<BR>
Seeing all my work.  Having space to work.<BR>
And I did get an important show.
<P>
But as the summer wore on,<BR> 
I missed the mountains<BR> 
and Gwen.
<P>
Didn't have the courage to call her.<BR>
If Sid hadn't told me <BR>
she was coming to the wedding party,<BR> 
I might never have seen her again.
<P>
Now she is outside.  I can see her sitting in 
her truck.  Trying to decide whether or not to come in,
I guess.

I felt sort of the same way after that Winter.<BR>
All I wanted to do was walk in the mountains,<BR>
hear the sound of the rushing water,<BR> 
melting snow,<BR>
wildflowers.<BR>
Sometimes in those first days of Spring,<BR>
I didn't want to go back to the cabin.<BR>
All I could remember was the deep snow<BR>
and the way not being able to get out<BR> 
made me feel.<BR>
Later I remembered the good things.<BR>
Eating dinner together<BR> 
while the snow fell in the darkness
outside our window.<BR>  
sitting at the table working,<BR>
looking out the window at the sun<BR>
on the new snow in the branches of the trees,<BR>
and all the beauty of Spring<BR> 
was lost in missing you.

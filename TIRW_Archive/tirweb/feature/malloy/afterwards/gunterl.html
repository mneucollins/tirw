Gwen,  There's a town in the mountains up North<BR>
where some artists I know have moved.<BR>  
It isn't as isolated as where we were living in Colorado.<BR> 
I think you might like it.<BR>
I mean it might be a place we could live. 
<P>
Will you drive up there with me tomorrow<BR>
and take a look?

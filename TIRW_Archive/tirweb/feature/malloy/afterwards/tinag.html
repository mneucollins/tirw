Jerry, I've known since a child that I wanted to be an artist.
There was never anything else that I wanted to do.
The things I remember...as a child -- crayons,  
rainy days, looking out the window at the trees and the grass, 
Drawing each blade of grass,
trying to draw the grass in different ways,
putting blue on top of green, adding yellow, and then more green, 
pushing the crayon back and forth on the paper,
watching the the world outside begin to take shape on paper.
Everything that I see, everywhere that I am,
I look at through this lens:
how to represent the environment, so that other people will see it as I do.

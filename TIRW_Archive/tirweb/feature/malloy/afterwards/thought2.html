I have only been here one day, 
and already I feel restless.
The time, the lack of entertainment 
should force me to start my book.
But I don't feel at home here.
<P>
"Convert the spare bedroom into an office,"
Dorothy said. 
How to begin in a place that feels like 
her house.
And writing the book --
the way I envision it --
will take talking to people.
I want to interview the artists
of my generation and older.
I'd like to walk the city streets
those artists walk;
look out my window at the city.
I wish I hadn't sold my house.
Dorothy told me not to,
but I thought it would be nice
if we had one place that we built together.
And it is.  It's just that...
I didn't realize how much I would miss the city.
<P>
I don't know whether or not to interupt 
Dorothy, to ask her if she'd like 
to have lunch with me.
I've worked with artists all my life.
I know what they are like.
<P>
But all my life I've wanted a real
relationship.  A home, a wife.

Damn. Now I can't concentrate.
Shouldn't have told Sid I didn't 
want to have lunch with him.
But I didn't.  Only now I do.
Wrong green. Needs a little
more yellow. 
<P>
How many painters
have painted grass?  Such an elemental brushstroke.
up and down.  up and down.
But not something I've done often in the past.
I didn't paint landscapes.
But the last two works...
And now this one.  These hills will look so beautiful.
The contrast in the other panel.
I want people to see that contrast.
What was there before the development.
What was lost.
Ahh.  That is exactly the right shade of
green.
<P>. 
What could we have for lunch?  Need to go to the
store.  Sid used to eat lunch out almost every day
when he lived in the city. When I'm working
I usually just open a can.  Eat whatever is in there.<BR>
What the hell.

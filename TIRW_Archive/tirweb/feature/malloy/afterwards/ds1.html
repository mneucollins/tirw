<P>     
Everybody is gone, and the house    
feels so empty.     
How beautiful the ocean is with the sun going down in the distance.    
<P>   
I want to make love to Dorothy tonight.  I thought about it while I   
watched her across the room, talking with her nieces and nephews.    
<P>  
When she   
danced with me I thought that tonight is our honeymoon night. So many   
years that we spent apart.   
<P>  
We danced together. I felt her familiar body through the thin cotton  
wedding dress, and I remembered how many years we were together in spirit
but not in the sharing of our lives.   
<P>   
For so many years in the mornings I woke up alone. 
<P>
Woke up alone. But almost every morning I walked to North Beach for
coffee.  There was usually someone I knew   
there, someone to talk with. Art, life, politics.    
<P>   
Tomorrow we leave for   
Flannagans Hill where there are no coffee houses within walking   
distance.

The luxury of lying in bed until  
noon after a memorable night  
is a pleasure I wish that Dorothy understood.  
But she is not here with me.  
<P>  
I imagine she is walking on the beach  
stopping to pick up shells.  
She is putting them in the pockets of her blue jeans.  
They are rolled up, and she is walking barefoot in the water.  
her hair tied back the way she wears it in the morning.    
While I lie here in the warm bed.

<P>    
Thank God the guests are gone!  Tomorrow we leave for the mountains.   
<P>   
It is not as if this is the first time  Sid and I have spent the night  
together. Yet this is different.  Honeymoon night. Our age. What   
difference does it make?  None whatsoever. Yet I feel as if I have waited
all my life for this night.   
<P>   
Surprising.  Not unhappy alone and always worried that if    
Sid and I...if this ever happened, I would lose the solitude so   
necessary for my work. This still worries me.  Yet there is an elation. 
A happiness I did not know existed. As if the years of unacknowledged   
grief gnawed at my soul, and I responded with unending work. Every   
painting the center of my life while I was working on it. The time   
between painting. Empty.  And then suddenly there is room for something 
else. This time with Sid we never had this. Yet not a loss of painting. 
Rather an opening of a part of my heart closed for so long. And still   
the painting continues. It too inseparable from my life.   
<P>

Such a beautiful morning.  
Feel of cold sea water on my bare feet.  
Sound of the waves going in and out.  
<P>  
Each shell lodged in the sand of interest.   
Have already picked up a few.   
A sand dollar, beautifully patterned   
as if etched by a renowned printer  
-- must remember to remove it from my pocket.  
<P>  
The sand --   
always a question of whether to represent each grain   
individually or to see the whole as a shimmering field beside the ocean.
Every painter seeing this  
differently.  
<P>   
Sid still sleeping.  The temptation to wake him up always so  
hard to resist. For me, lying in bed after the sun is up  
is impossible.

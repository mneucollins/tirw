<P>    
Everybody is gone, and the house   
feels so empty.    
How beautiful the ocean is with the sun going down in the distance.   
<P>  
I want to make love to Dorothy tonight.  I thought about it while I  
watched her across the room, talking with her nieces and nephews.   
<P> 
When she  
danced with me I thought that tonight is our honeymoon night. So many  
years that we spent apart.  
<P> 
We danced together. I felt her familiar body through the thin cotton 
wedding dress, and I remembered how many years we were together in spirit

but not in the sharing of our lives.  
<P>  
For so many years in the mornings I woke up alone. Almost every morning I

walked to North Beach for coffee.  There was usually someone I knew  
there, someone to talk with. Art, life, politics.   
<P>  
Tomorrow we leave for  
Flannagan's Hill where there are no coffee houses within walking  
distance.

The luxury of lying in bed until 
noon after a memorable night 
is a pleasure I wish that Dorothy understood. 
But she is not here with me. 
<P> 
I imagine she is walking on the beach 
stopping to pick up shells. 
She is putting them in the pockets of her blue jeans. 
They are rolled up, and she is walking barefoot in the water. 
her hair tied back the way she wears it in the morning.   
While I lie here in the warm bed. 
<P> 
That fellow Gunter left with a women he talks about 
all the time.  Once he asked me what he should do. 
"Call her," I said.   
<P> 
But I don't think that he did. 
<P> 
He was lucky that Dorothy knew her.  Gwen.  She came all the way  
from Colorado. By her self.  
I wonder if they 
spent the night together.</B>

<B>Thank God the guests are gone!  Tomorrow we leave for the mountains.  
<P>  
It is not as if this is the first time  Sid and I have spent the night  
together. Yet this is different.  Honeymoon night. Our age. What  
difference does it make?  None whatsoever. Yet I feel as if I have waited

 
all my life for this night.  
<P>  
Surprising.  Not unhappy alone and always worried that if   
Sid and I...if this ever happened, I would lose the solitude so  
necessary for my work. This still worries me.  Yet there is an elation. 

A happiness I did not know existed. As if the years of unacknowledged  
grief gnawed at my soul and I responded with unending work. Every  
painting the center of my life while I was working on it. The time  
between painting. Empty.  And then suddenly there is room for something 

else. This time with Sid we never had this. Yet not a loss of painting. 

Rather an opening of a part of my heart closed for so long. And still  
the painting continues. It too inseparable from my life.

Such a beautiful morning. 
Feel of cold sea water on my bare feet. 
Sound of the waves going in and out. 
<P> 
Each shell lodged in the sand of interest.  
Have already picked up a few.  
A sand dollar, beautifully patterned  
as if etched by a renowned printer 
-- must remember to remove it from my pocket. 
<P> 
The sand --  
always a question of whether to represent each grain  
individually or to see the whole as a shimmering field beside the ocean.

Every painter seeing this 
differently. 
<P>  
Sid still sleeping.  The temptation to wake him up always so 
hard to resist. For me, lying in bed after the sun is up 
is impossible.    
<P> 
Yesterday Tina and Jerry looked so happy! 
<P> 
I wonder if Gwen and Gunter spent the night together.

<blockquote>   
This work -- <i>Dorothy and Sid - Interlude 2</i> --   
will eventually be composed of a series of parallel and interlinked
scrolls 
in which Dorothy and Sid's thoughts are displayed next to each other   
in a narrative data structure. The Dorothy and Sid scroll will be  
punctuated with interlinking screens of their conversations and of
conversations between Tina and Jerry 
and between Gwen and Gunter. This structure is somewhat similar to the
narrative data structure 
I used in <i>Wasting Time</i> -- which over ten years ago used slowly
appearing text 
to simulate conversation and connected columns of words to simulate
parallel thought  
patterns -- and was published in <i>After the Book (Perforations 3)</i>
Summer, 1992.   
 
The way the screens are interlinked is likely to change as the piece
takes shape.   
Readers are invited to visit this --  
<A HREF="http://www.judymalloy.net/intaud.html" target="_top"> 
my virtual studio</A> -- as the work evolves.

<p><b>BS:</b> What digital poetry are you looking at now? Also, do you see the period now as being one of fulfillment of the promises of digital poetry, or as one that is foundational for a later period, when, perhaps, more poets are also programmers? Are there digital artists outside the field of &quot;digital poetry&quot; that interest you?</p>
<p><b>JC:</b> When I manage to read, I confess I don't immediately distinguish digital from other poetry or writing; nor do I make a point of seeking out the former over the latter. The next thing I'd like to find time to read is Lydia Davis' (is it really that Lydia Davis?) translations of Proust. For the past few years I have not been using the Web a great deal. This is partly a function of still being a dial-up, narrow-pipe user, while the perceived and actual requirement for much web-based work is broad-to-bloated. (This is despite my involvement in a collaborative broadband multimedia project: <a href="http://www.z360.com/what">www.z360.com/what</a>) I hardly feel able to point to specific or specifically digital writers. As a critic of writing in networked and programmable media I'd tend to encourage a reading of work that does one of two things. </p>
<p>Firstly, work that&#151;formally, by instantiating the emergent characteristics of a practice&#151;addresses the kind of issues raised above concerning textuality generally and programmed writing as such. Although I hope it's clear that I'm not recommending formalism for it's own sake. In this context, Phillipe Bootz and the writers associated with <i>aLire </i>are important for historicizing writing in programmable media, opening it to practice in Europe, in languages other than English, and in ways that are not in any sense reducible to so-called hypertext. Jim Rosenberg's forms and theories have also been very important to me; insisting on technical and theoretical relations with hypertext but extending and denying it in practice. Programmer-poets Judd Morrisey and Lori Tally will continue to make good work, richly programmatological as well as poetic per se. Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier is a long-time source of poetic pleasure and reference for me, committed both to programming, and to making with language and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. Through Glazier's work I often find myself linking back to the schools of poetry in America from which I continue to learn or attempt to learn. I hope Bruce Andrews becomes more of an electronic poet in senses he prefers. Joan Retallack seems to have no need of silicon to achieve effects far beyond most of what I hope and desire. You and Kenneth Goldsmith keep me more than interested in work made on and for new media, and your links to language art are clear. In the UK there are far fewer writers in networked and programmable media with whom I'd care to hang. cris cheek and recent collaborator Kirsten Lavers are important exceptions. Then there are a number of writers moving into the field, or who may cease resisting or being resisted by it: Elizabeth James, Caroline Bergvall, Peter Manson. </p>
<p>Secondly (I guess I have got round to a secondly), I look to work that establishes something that may be what Bruce Andrews calls 'social informalism' in poetic practice. Andrews points to a poetics that is socially engaged and moves beyond formalism to real human (inter)action through artistic language use and making. On the net and in new media this&#151;potentially and in a number of demonstrable instances&#151;translates to the spawning of radical, marginal, evanescent, provisional text art communities and collaborations that come together in software virtuality. Maria Damon, critic but also collaborator with mEIKAL aND, has begun to identify examples and characteristics of this poetic practice and a number of such soft, edgy groupings. Working in and with MOOs, I believe that Katherine Parrish has already made significant contribution and will go on to do more. I enjoy the expansiveness of mEIKAL aND's projects and collaborations: poetry as this radical communal interaction. </p>
<p>Much work outside the field of 'digital poetry' also interests me, although I suppose it may be more productive to briefly cite a few practitioners whose work overlaps and engages with the making of text art&#151;Jodi, Camille Utterback, Michael Atavar, Giselle Bieguelman, and David Rokeby, whose 'Giver of Names' and, more recently, 'n-Cha(n)t' are perhaps the most affective trails of language (=poetry) that I have experienced in this context. </p>
<p>I'm not sure I see the current period as 'foundational', as you put it, certainly not in terms of some future for poet(ic) programming. It may well prove harder for writers to program in the future, if the software companies continue to hide the 'inner workings' from us, leaving us with media fetishes, stuck in the thick surface of GUI goo, wallowing from one dying, outmoded environment to the next utopian, hardware-gobbling upgrade, endlessly buying superstructure for our subscriptions to globally capitalized networked broadcasting as we go. Sometimes the world of text on the Internet seems utterly foobar. I used to love the rhizomatic academy of the listservs; now my in box fills with unsolicited spam, at a ratio of about thirty slime-junk invitations to one properly addressed missive keyed by an entity I know or love. As the pipes broaden&#151;culturally as well as commercially&#151;I no longer expect that ratio to improve. </p>
<p>It's profoundly infuriating, but, on the other hand, I enjoy this time when there are few enough practitioners and theorists of programmatological poetic form that conferences and festivals can bring a large proportion of them together at one time, and do so such that the aesthetics, politics and social engagements of the various participants may be utterly disparate. Whatever it is that brings these people together spans wide chasms of critical difference and potential antagonism. This also allows unexpected alliances and opportunities to learn. In my own case, once an eastward-looking, neo-imagist, lonely-in-the-bamboo lyricist-translator; I now, for example, contemplate literally signing over my unconscious to a free-wheeling assemblage of hacker-poets in the myour darkness of a MOO. But generally, in these gatherings, what some of us are looking for is a resonance between emergent form and practice&#151;cultural and social practice. The wager we make is that because the delivery or performance media are, technically, open to us, in that they are fully programmable, we will be able to explore and reconfigure our compositional media as never before. And if the world of letters can be reconfigured&#151;even through the rigours of programming&#151;then its underlying structures and characteristics were always already different from what had been passed down to us, re-revealing latent rhetorics: software ways to make it new. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

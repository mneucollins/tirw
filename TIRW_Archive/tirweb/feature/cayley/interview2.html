<p><b>Brian Stefans:</b> Prior to engaging in digital poetry, you were heavily invested in Asian poetry and poetics&#151;you make your living with your Asian bookstore in London, I believe&#151;and continue to work with artists such as Xu Bing. When I've read descriptions of your work it often centers around the elements of digital textuality but rarely does it try to deal with the relationship to Asian poetry. I could speculate and suggest that there is a quiet attentiveness to issues of time and a passive reception to experience that departs from the Western agonistic subjectivity that seems a component of both reading and writing lyric poetry in European (Romantic) traditions. </p>
<p>How do you see your projects relating to Asian aesthetics? Do you think it's necessary for a reader of your work&#151;as one might suggest with Cage's work&#151;to understand some of the principles of Asian philosophies such as Buddhism?</p>
<p><b>John Cayley:</b> I'm university trained in what was once called 'Chinese language and civilization.' This could be seen as the equivalent of taking a three-year degree in 'European language (sic) and civilization' within the domain of the other major 'center of polity' on the planet. Think of what that might signify&#151;how we would feel, as 'Europeans' (with 'American' subsumed in the term), if our culture were studied in that way. I did some post-graduate work in classical Chinese literature, worked as a Chinese section reference librarian in the British Library, and now run a bookshop specializing in East Asian art. I remain on the margins of the academic study of Chinese culture. I still engage with and publish in the field from time to time, with the Chinese writing system and Chinese calligraphy as an art of writing having become my chief academic interests. During all this time I maintained a serious interest in classical Chinese poetry and poetics which complemented my reading and writing in English. I translated early Chinese poetry and continue to do so from time to time.</p>
<p>Chinese investments have informed my practice of writing in programmable media from my first essays and experiments. In 'wine flying' &#151;first programmed in Basic on a 6502 computer in the late 1970s&#151;the animation of a translation from a classical quatrain aimed, in part, to exemplify and instantiate certain principles of Chinese poetics, which are less accessible to print-published translation.[<a href="#1">1</a>] Specifically, for example, 'wine flying' animates strategies of readings associated with parallelism, writing in 'parallel' lines which share the same or similar syntax while providing semantic variation, contrast, and correspondence (familiar to readers of English poetry in the Psalms). This figure invites non- or multi-linear reading, which can be animated in time, embodying and performing poetics which are interiorized in other cultures and media.</p>
<p>Later, in my writing for programmable media, I became more interested in procedural text modulation and generation. Like others before me&#151;Emmett Williams, Jackson Mac Low, Cage&#151;I found myself using the 'smaller' atomic structures of language in order to derive algorithms for programming text. Chiefly, I have been using letters. Without ever losing sight of my Chinese investments, this necessarily led me away from Chinese poetics for reasons I have gradually begun to understand and theorize. There is a radical disjuncture between the western, Roman, alphabetic system of inscription and the Chinese, character-based system.[<a href="#2">2</a>] The atomic structure of written language and, I would argue, language-as-such differs in the two centers of 'language and civilization.' (I lean heavily and happily on Derrida in taking this view.) These differences are translated to digital media because linguistic structure itself&#151;not simply linguistic 'data'&#151;is transcribed by the entire historical process of digitization, taken to include the design of computing systems and data structures, not merely the actual transcription of cultural objects into bits and bytes. Basically, our programmatological systems reflect their derivation from an alphabetic system of linguistic inscription. Thus, I can easily use existing programming systems to manipulate western language in ways which correspond to encoded structures which are approximately 'faithful' to the language. It is easy to refer to letters as constituent of words, for instance. By contrast, it would be difficult, using existing systems in a straightforward way, to refer to the constituents of Chinese characters. Inevitably, in the first instance, while developing ideas and programs for text manipulation, I have taken advantage of the encoded structures of western language. I remain sharply aware that I am complicit with a privileged symbolic structure in doing so, recognizing that digitization could have been very different, commensurate with characters rather than letters. A recognition of this problematic underlies my most recent finished piece, 'riverIsland,' which might otherwise be read as some sort of transcultural pastoral/lyric poetic exercise.</p>
<p>While it is true that whatever aesthetic my work may represent is strongly influenced by the Chinese culture-inflected tendencies you identify&#151;including 'quiet attentiveness to issues of time and a passive reception to experience' &#151;I nonetheless consider it to emerge as strongly from what I think of as an engaged formalism, a formalism which addresses other, less usual matters of language&#151;both potential form and form deriving, in my case, from Chinese poetics, from my understanding of the materiality of the Chinese language. In so far as my work produces an aesthetic response, I don't expect this to be the result of some prior engagement by the reader with Chinese thought or poetry. I would hope, however, that my own concerns might be somehow apparent in the work (they seem to be from your reading at least) and that readers would be encouraged to appreciate the problems I am trying to address and perhaps go on to undertake their own explorations of the 'language and civilization' of the 'other Greek.'[<a href="#3">3</a>] <a href="interview2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

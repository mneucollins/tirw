<p><b>JC:</b> It's interesting that you mention 'atoms' in your question and also something an invitation to me. Lately I have been much concerned with thinking about and trying to theorize the characteristics of what I conceive as 'atoms of signification' in textual or, as I sometimes call it, literal art. I take an atom of signification to be any entity&#151;here a linguistic entity&#151;which can be considered to be irreducible&#151;impossible to otherwise recast or, when addressing the matter of language, to paraphrase, for example. In the realm of writing, both authors and readers will generally agree that letters are atoms in this sense. Many of my pieces (and those of other programmatological authors) proceed by programming atomic identities at the level of letters as such. However, it is clear to me that atoms of signification may emerge as complex entities&#151;automata&#151;at any arbitrary point of linguistic structure: letters, phrases, lines, ideograms (in the Poundian sense),whole passages, or works. One way of defining a poem may be to say that it is a linguistic construct of arbitrary size, complexity or length which is irreducible: it cannot be paraphrased; it is itself an atom of signification.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the questions you are asking? Most recently, along with other critics and theorists I have been articulating a dissatisfaction with even a poststructurist understanding of the materiality of language&#151;of writing in particular&#151;when addressing textual art in networked and programmable media. It is increasingly clear to me that the intervention of programming at the scene of writing&#151;which is played out in runtime operations during the performances of reading&#151;makes it impossible to ignore or bracket the intrinsic temporality of atoms of signfication in textual art. This is not really a new perspective. An elaborated notion of, for example, 'performance writing' has circulated in circles associated with innovative poetics. Still, I believe, the instantiations of explicitly programmed writing in appropriate media makes certain characteristics of this practice easier to appreciate.</p>
<p>What are the atoms of sigification in a work like riverIsland? You ask about its textually morphing transitions from one natural-language verse or version to another. Heraclitus' famous remark is a truism, applicable to any experience in any media, and requiring no reinforcement from a work of mine. The point here is that, in at least one interpretative mode, riverIsland's atoms of signification encompass the so-called nodal texts along with the potential transitions: the inputs, the operations, their outputs <i>and </i>the actual duration of the transition. The textual sign is more like a cinematic loop or clip, except that its frames may also be generated on the fly&#151;as they are in this case&#151;according to rules and constraints. Actually, given this kind of perspective, a reader can and probably does return to any or all of riverIsland's identical-in-this-sense passages (with the implicit temporality of 'passage' providing us with a useful term, albeit metaphorically inflected). I do not think that this return is, qualitatively, all that different from the many returns which take place when we reread or recall passages that are published and performed in the more persistent material substrates of print culture. What cannot be, as I say, ignored, bracketed or even poststructurally deferred is the fact that the programming&#151;necessarily concealed but manifestly operative and ultimately itself interpretable&#151; produces a sign that has time and change built into it, that incorporates, instantiates and participates in the culture of human time. The signifier itself is programmed and as such has both operations and durations.</p>
<p>Thus, the point is not to say that particular frames of some transitional textual loop manifest phonetic or semantic relationships with natural languages (although the design of the algorithm encourages them to do so) because of the letter salad clustering. The reading strategy for this kind of work must be able to embrace the experience and interpretation of the elements and transitions as a durational whole.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how or whether you see your question about metaphor as relating to issues concerning complexity of interface and the introduction of multimedia elements. It seems clear that imagery introduced in a textual or literary context can be metaphorically directive or even restrictive. However, for example, the degree to which graphic material is abstract (and so resistant to metaphor) is arbitrary. riverIsland combines/interleaves imagistic, metaphoric and abstract registers in both its literal and graphic elements. It's hard to say which media directs the other, although I still think of myself as working in literal art. riverIsland is relatively construable in terms of traditional lyric and translation, but it also engages a number of experiments in linguistic abstraction and deconstruction. There is also to be considered the western misappropriation of Chinese imagism&#151;to which the originals of riverIsland subscribe&#151;which is not, generally speaking, metaphoric or symbolic. It is not reliant on a notion of transcendence, but more a naturalistic representation of an immanent idealism.</p>
<p>As for complexity of interface, to give a brief answer, I think this is a function of its engagement with the programming of the signifier, as outlined sketchily above. It's not that the interface is complex, it's just that it is unfamiliar; there is no accepted set of ways to modulate language that might have led to the design of a consistent and familiar interface, an interface which writers generally would be prepared to use. Any number of operations may be programmed and applied to the material of language. In a sense the operations associated with print publication and reading are simply one such, historically and culturally significant application, although its operations are not traditionally designed by those artists we call authors or writers. Writers have always been concerned with the publication, the paratextual programming, of their work; some deeply so: artist-poet printers and bookmakers come to mind, along with the poetic traditional developing from Mallarm&eacute;. Naturally some writers have gone on to explore the more radical control over textual representation that new media allow (as well as trying to realize theoretically the implications of these innovations). The problem is that there is no predetermined shape to the machines and instruments of textual representation in new media. No one yet knows what form a culturally preferred textual 'projector', for example, will take. At a very early stage of the game I tried to write a fairly generalized poetic text animator (which I imagined would 'score the spelt air'). This was long overtaken by technology, but still no such off-the-shelf software exists. Even 'microserf' startups don't write software for poets. Instead we have Flash, cunningly (mis)directed to make letters dream, as you have superbly demonstrated.</p>
<p>My point is that we are currently writers trying to build relatively simple textual instruments that are intuitive and, hopefully, both affective and significant when they are played. I mean played as musical instruments or sequencers or mixers are played. This is ergodic indeed, but still distinguishable from (hard) work or from the type of play in games which is rewarded by winning, by other forms of 'success' or simply by 'playability'.</p>
<p>The instructions for riverIsland do get in the way of pleasures derived from artistic inscrutability but the alternative would be either to make the piece run itself (which it could do as an installation for example) or to wait until a 'projector' which could encompass its methods and operations was generally understood and available in the culture. When will that happen? In the meantime many of us will continue to apply operations to texts and continue to build machines and instruments that readers will have to learn to operate and play, and that will sometimes require some introduction and explanation. <a href="interview6.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

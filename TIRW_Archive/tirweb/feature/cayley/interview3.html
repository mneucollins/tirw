<p><b>BS:</b> I notice in Loss Glazier's <i>Digital Poetics: The Making of E-Poetries</i>, that on at least two occasions he cites a reading that you've both given in the context of a digital literature conference as exemplifying an &quot;innovative&quot; position that is generally underrepresented in both conferences and the critical industry on digital literature. These differences usually hinge on the use of narrative in digital literature&#151;Glazier even notes an assumption that digital literature is usually theorized as if it were always going to be prose&#151;and on the presence of a lyrical &quot;I.&quot; </p>
<p>I have several divergent questions based on these issues, one of which is: what do you feel your role has been in the circuit of conferences on digital literature (I understand that you attend many of them, and are not afraid to take direct issue with theorists such as N. Katherine Hayles and Florian Cramer <a href="http://www.electronicbookreview.com/v3/servlet/ebr?command=view_essay&essay_id=cayleyele" target="_blank">[see The Code is Not a Text on the EBR]</a>) and do you think your ideas have been appreciated and responded to adequately? Do you agree with Glazier that there is something inherently inhospitable to the lyrical &quot;I&quot; and to narrative in digital poetries? In terms of how this literature is getting beyond the conferences, how have you seen the public acceptance of digital literature change over the course of the many years you've been involved in it?</p>
<p><b>JC:</b> It's interesting to reflect on what seemed to be going on when I began to attend conferences devoted to 'hypertext' and, later, 'digital literature' in late 1990s. I'd been making literary experiments with text using personal computers since the late 1970s. So had many others, as an adjunct to many distinct varieties of textual practice. Sadly, they seem to have shared remarkably little intercommunication. Why would bp nichol necessarily want to tell the OuLiPo what he was doing with his Apple II? It was only after the World Wide Web, as it were, 'went public' in 1994 that it was suddenly possible to conceive of a community of practice and a more general audience for writing in networked and programmable media, for writing that was made for and delivered by these media. This is not to say that much such writing actually existed. The idea that 'new' textual media might be generalized and shared had only just emerged. There were a small number of practitioners, a small number of systems for composing text in digital media and a growing realization that at some indeterminate point in the future an indeterminate quantity of text and textual practice would migrate to the new 'writing space' of networked programmatons. In the English-speaking world the literary faction of this emergent field was dominated by a group of writers and theorists who were chiefly invested in prose fiction and post structuralism, and in a variety of hypertext that was slightly more configurable than link-node html. In common with the designers of the Web, however, they were relatively uninterested in programming the matter of language within the node or, indeed, within the link. Jim Rosenberg was a notable exception in this community. He bridged an even larger gap. The hypertext conferences have a strong technical constituency to which Jim, as programmer and systems person, fervently subscribed. Meanwhile his work explicitly addressed precisely those issues of what happens inside the node and inside the link. He was crucial in inviting me and others like me&#151;Glazier and Funkhouser in the first memorable instance, along with French practitioners, Balpe and Bootz&#151;into the literary stream of the hypertext conferences. Once more, a small number of poets were asking to have their rhetorical concerns addressed in a context dominated by the persuasive requirements of paraphrasable fiction and restructured instruction manuals, all over-egged with theory and tech. Perhaps not so different from the average university department of English??</p>
<p>Then the Scandinavians, already a significant presence at the hypertext conferences, hit the scene and made their own. The conference I have been attending most regularly is DAC, Digital Arts and Culture, established by Espen Aarseth and colleagues out of Bergen in Norway and, latterly, a transatlantic event. As is now well-known, Aarseth's book on cybertext established a reference 'textonomy,' a taxonomy of textuality, <i>in the context o</i>f but independent of so-called new media. The DAC approach to what was considered as literary art was catholic and nuanced especially in terms of form, in terms of delivery and compositional mediation. There was more of a sense that the approach was empirical, prepared to receive and examine what was actually being produced and offered as textual art inclusively: from hypertext fiction to html poetry, to literary performance in MOO-space, or virtual-visceral computer games for SoHo. By contrast, the hypertext conference appeared as an attempt to realize a dream or instantiate some (paradoxically and anti-poetically Platonic) idea of a node-linked literary utopia of prose.</p>
<p>Your questions are pertinent in all this. I have indeed seen myself as assuming a position and a role in these communities, basically as a representative of poetics in the less metaphorical sense, poetics as engaged by practitioner-performers rather than as used by theorists of prose applying a genre-alien, problematic-but-perceived-as-powerful methodology to their analyses. I was less clear of this position and role at first since my re-engagement with so-called experimental, so-called innovative poetic writing&#151;with which I feel allied&#151;coincided with my joining the digital literature communities. I found I had a parallel contribution to offer in the discussions emerging amongst self-identified poets over new media and concerning writing that is explicitly mediated, procedurally, programmatologically. Anyway, to return to my role in the digital literature community, within the existing critical and theoretical discussion, I help to bring to bear a poetic practitioner's awareness of and sensitivity to the grainy, atomic materiality of language&#151;the language within the node and certain language-embodied transition effects that may constitute the link. Thankfully, questions revolving around materiality have very much come to the fore, especially in recent debates, exposing and throwing into relief many earlier critical and theoretical inadequacies and excesses. <a href="interview4.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

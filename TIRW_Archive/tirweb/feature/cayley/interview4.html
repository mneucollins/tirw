<p><b><font size="1">Interview with John Cayley page 4</font></b></p>
<p>As a writer who is also, to a certain extent, a programmer, I am currently attempting to make a specific contribution to our understanding of the relationship between text and code, especially where the literary object has become a coded object, a text containing code which 'runs' and forces us to confront signifiers which, because they are themselves programmed, can only perform their meaning-creation in operations that are unambiguously time-based and optionally transactive with their readers. I believe that, despite what might be seen as a slow burn, these contributions&#151;concerning linguistic materiality and coding&#151;are being appreciated in the digital literature debates and will continue to be so.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to see that any form of mediation is in itself complicit with a particular ideology or practice. New media can be and is applied to the construction of narrative and texts which cite and center on a lyric 'I.' I agree with Glazier that the predominance of these tropes tends to prevent or undermine the emergence of far other potentialities arising from, in particular, explicitly poetic writing, poetic writing that has developed from those strands of modernism which have not been reabsorbed into the paraphrasable, banal, domestic, de-politicized lyric, so often (merely) decorated with traditional (new-for-old) formalism. I do also agree that the quantity and quality of mediation made available to writers by programmable machines requires them to address the implications of what they find themselves doing and how, as makers, they find themselves making. Narrative and the lyric 'I' have already experienced the challenges of modern history and critical thought, and have, in my opinion, been forced to acknowledge that their persistent predominance is a function of constructed authority and privilege rather than some essential ideal humanity. Now they face the challenge of a range of mediation, the mechanics of which is (currently) open to its makers: either because these inner workings are as-yet little understood and rarely applied to literary objects or, more importantly, because they require new rhetorics and new aesthetics, emergent from these processes of mediation themselves.</p>
<p>As for reception beyond the conferences, this is hard for me to gauge. As a hard-bitten poet with other-work to keep me in the garret to which I have become accustomed, I have never expected large audiences for my work. It does not appear that even the kind of hypertextualized prose fiction that can be easily translated to the Web (big virtual numbers) has achieved any kind of popular acceptance. There are no truly famous or celebrity hypertext authors. Mark Amerika and Shelley Jackson have, I guess, what are called cult followings. The best-known patron of electronic literature, Robert Coover, is probably better known than the best known author, Michael Joyce. But perhaps your question isn't about some potential entry into popular culture. There is still the problem of 'platform', the fact any such work depends upon a particular regime of hardware and software in a world where the stability and accessibility of a platform is dependent upon private commercial criteria which have little or no regard for art, aesthetics or politics, and a fundamentally venal regard for media in the broadcast or distributable-for-payment sense. I, for one, persist in making work which may soon become impossible to disseminate because of the demise of a particular platform. That said, when I have been able to get my work seen, especially in the quasi-performative space of a gallery installation or in actual performance (where I can see and hear how my readers react), I have found that they are appreciative and open to the kind of literary objects in new media that I have made.</p>
<p><b>BS:</b> From Espen Aarseth one learns of the term &quot;ergodic,&quot; which I will loosely paraphrase as a literature that requires more than trivial effort&#151;say, turning the page&#151;to read. Your piece riverIsland&#151;which, unlike earlier hypercard works of yours, has longish periods between each static &quot;poem&quot; of intermingling letters, and employs a fairly complex interface involving interactive Quicktime movies&#151;seems your furthest venture into the &quot;ergodic.&quot; The poem suggests a relationship not just between between exploring an island and exploring an interface, but between the &quot;blur&quot; of Quicktime photography and programmed letter salads and the blur of the rushing atoms of water&#151;digital self-creation being likened to natural, but elusive physical processes. One can suggest, reductively, that the overarching theme seems to be the line attributed to Heraclitus: you can't step into the same river twice. </p>
<p>With the increase in the use of photographic images and programmatic elements in &quot;poems,&quot; how do you see metaphor operating in a work like this&#151;is metaphor itself under fire? Also, how do you see the relationship of the scrambled texts between the poems to the poems which one hears in your soundtrack being read&#151;themselves? What sort of reading strategy do you believe a person will employ to read these sections as they unfold through time, and is the morphing from one poem to another intended to spawn particular types of clusters&#151; i.e. are some of the arbititrarily created letter-clusters supposed to relate to other languages, like Gaelic, or to avant-gardist type works? Lastly, there seems to be an issue of the included text files and the instructions for the interface&#151;do you think this detracts from the special quality of art that partly impresses you by its very inscrutability? <a href="interview5.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

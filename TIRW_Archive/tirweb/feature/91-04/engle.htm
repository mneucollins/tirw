        (Bai Hua Press: Beijing, &nbsp;2004)</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Hualing Nieh Engle and Paul Engle: A Dialogue</strong><br>
        The Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop</p>
        <p><strong> Hualing:</strong>&nbsp; Paul, tell me about the Writers' Workshop.&nbsp; It's such an important part of your life.&nbsp; </p>
        <p> <strong>Paul</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see how we can be together all of these years without my talking about the Writers&rsquo; Workshop.&nbsp; Because it was in my capacity as the director of the Writers' Workshop, the Rockefeller Foundation gave me a large grant in 1963 to go around the world, in particular Asia, and meet writers.&nbsp; So, if I had not built the Workshop into an instrument, if I may say so, no boasting, this is a fact, with national prestige--its reputation was everywhere, the Foundation would never have given me that grant and I would not have met you.&nbsp; So, you see, things link together in human life.&nbsp; </p>
        <p> When I came back from Oxford in 1936, I had no job.&nbsp; I was offered a job by Williams College in Massachusetts, a terribly good, nice college in a beautiful location in northwestern Massachusetts.&nbsp; I somehow felt I didn't want to settle down in New England. This was home.</p>
        <p> <strong>H</strong>: Why?&nbsp; New England is so beautiful.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Well, it's a marvelous place, of course, but this was home.&nbsp; I wanted to be here a while.&nbsp; So, while I was here, a man named Norman Forster invited me to come and teach at the University of Iowa.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  What was he?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  He was the director of what was called the School of Letters.&nbsp; One of his greatest achievements was to offer students courses and credits in what was then called the creative writing for degrees.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  The University offered it even in the &lsquo;30s?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Oh, yes.&nbsp; I took my degree here with a book of original poetry.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  But you were not the first to get that degree with a manuscript.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P</strong>:  Not a manuscript.&nbsp; A book.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  You were the first?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P</strong>:  I cannot say that.&nbsp; I don't know anyone else who submitted a book of original poems as a thesis for the degree of Master of Arts. To my knowledge, I was the first.&nbsp; That book, <em>Worn Eart</em>h, had won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize, and&nbsp; I submitted that as my thesis.</p>
        <p>  &nbsp;<strong>H</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Which year did you come to the University of Iowa? &nbsp;   </p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>P:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1937.&nbsp; Wilber Schremm ran the Writers' Workshop.&nbsp; I taught with him.</p>
        <p>  &nbsp;<strong>H:</strong>  It was already called the Writers' Workshop?</p>
        <p>  &nbsp;<strong>P:</strong>  Yes.&nbsp; It was his idea to call it that.&nbsp; However, when I took it over ...</p>
        <p>  <strong>&nbsp;H:</strong>  He left?</p>
        <p>  <strong>&nbsp;P:</strong>  He left.&nbsp; And when I took over the Writer's Workshop, it was nothing like it is today.&nbsp; It was one little class and there're eight students.&nbsp; All of them, brilliantly untalented.&nbsp; So there I began. I had, if I may say so, absolute vision after the first Workshop meeting, I saw this is it. I wanted to get into this. I wanted to go on teaching writing, teaching contemporary literature, teaching the new English poetry, the new French, German poetry, and get a degree of our own, make writing something. It was a conscious thing; it didn&rsquo;t just happen by blind chance. </p>
        <p>  I grew up in a horse barn. I was accustomed to work. Furthermore, if you have to deal with administrators, it&rsquo;s very wise, if before that, you learn to deal with horses. You have to learn to be kicked around. No offense to the Dean or the President. But I was unknown here. I&rsquo;d done a few things that they recognized academically, but there was opposition to the Writers&rsquo; Workshop. You musn&rsquo;t think I was handed it on a platter. There were people who didn&rsquo;t want writers around. One of the senior members of the Department said, &ldquo;You know what you oughta do with writers? Put&rsquo;em in concrete and sink&rsquo;em in the Iowa River. &ldquo;</p>
        <p> <em>&nbsp;Paul and Hualing laughing.</em></p>
        <p> <strong>P:</strong>&nbsp;Do you know something? I would kick him in the ass before he could sink us in the Iowa River.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><em>Both laughing again.</em></p>
        <p> <strong>P:</strong>&nbsp;So I suddenly realized, Look, you can&rsquo;t leave it to chance. If you want talent, you gotta find out where talent is and then go get it, and for that, you need money. I established a chain of friends all around the country. Wally Stegner in Stanford, John Crow Ranson at Kenyon College, Allen Tate at Suwani, somebody at Columbia, somebody at Harvard. They didn&rsquo;t have openings for writes. Every year, I would write to them and they would send me the names of their best people who had finished with work at those institutions. And I would bring them here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all fashionable now. We were the first. So gradually&nbsp; word got around: Iowa is the place.</p>
        <p>  That is why I began, if I may mention a subject many people don't like, why I began to raise money.&nbsp; I realized if I didn't raise money, most of that talent would not come to the Workshop, because it was a small university.&nbsp; There simply was not enough money within the University.&nbsp; The reason that the Writers' Workshop succeeded was largely due to the Graduate Dean, George Starddard, with whom I worked very closely.&nbsp; And the head of the English Department, Baldwin Maxwell, both of whom supported me, gave me such money as they could spare.&nbsp; Without them, the Workshop wouldn't have gone along, being a little tiny class without talent.&nbsp; So every year I had some scholarships and gradually a few research assistantships and then a few teaching assistantships.&nbsp; Now the teaching assistantships have grown into a major funding part of the Writers' Workshop.&nbsp; All of this is not merely history.&nbsp; It was because in the '40s and '50s I had managed with the help of these people to get the Workshop to bring terribly talented people, many of whom later went on to win Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, The Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize which I won earlier in 1932.&nbsp; I then began going out for money.&nbsp; That took me to the Rockefeller Foundation.&nbsp; Whenever I went to New York, which I did two or three times a year, the Foundation was kind enough to see me.&nbsp; They would listen.&nbsp; Finally I did get a grant from them, first one they ever gave to a university for writers.&nbsp; But not permanent, of course.&nbsp; Finally one year, 1962, I was in New York in the autumn, and I said to the officer at the Foundation, &quot;You know why I am here.&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;Yes, you're looking for money.&nbsp; And you won't take no for answer.&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;Maybe I will this time, if you're not clever enough to say yes.&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;Well, look, why don't you have a look at writers in other places.&nbsp; I know you had three years in Europe, and you met all the new English writers, so famous.&nbsp; I feel you ought to expand your horizon by going away from a semester in particular to Asia.&quot;&nbsp; So, I went to Asia, and met you in Taiwan.</p>
        <p> When I was the director of the Writers' Workshop, I took intense interests in their lives, not only their writing.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  That's very important. </p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  I was constantly meeting strangers, whom I had admitted to the Writers' Workshop. They had to submit writing in order to be able to come.&nbsp; At the bus station, at the railway station.&nbsp; They didn't come by plane, there was no plane at that time.&nbsp; Furthermore, they couldn't have afforded it.&nbsp; And I got them rooms.&nbsp; I got some of our writers, after they had been here a year or two, to manage rooming houses; they would put up the young writers coming in, who had no place to stay, in the basement on a mattress behind the furnace.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  I noticed that when I first met you in Taiwan in 1963, you tried very hard to get the visa for Wai-lim Yep's wife.&nbsp; You know how important the wife is to the poet.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P</strong>:  Of course, I know! (A naughty smile.)&nbsp; Oh, I made the Writers' Workshop a very large affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  Which year did you resign?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  I resigned in 1966, I think.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  Paul, maybe the time was right for you to develop the Workshop.&nbsp; Just after the World War II.&nbsp; Many young people came back from the war, from the army, they were talented and they had no place to go, and they came here, and became very famous writers.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  This was absolutely right, Hualing.&nbsp; Because here, there was a place which recognized talent, and here, they felt completely at home to do anything they wanted.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  Paul, at that time, it was a &quot;writer boom.&quot; Right?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Yes!&nbsp; A writer boom.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  That generation, immediately after Hemingway's generation, many of them have become very good writers.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>P</strong>:  Yes.&nbsp; For example, a young poet from Pennsylvania, his name was W.D. Snodgrass.&nbsp; He had just come back from the Navy in the South Pacific.&nbsp; I got him a little grant on the basis of one poem he sent.&nbsp; It was obvious that he had talent.&nbsp; I had, if I may say so, a nose for sniffing out talent.&nbsp; The way a dog sniffs out a bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so D. came.&nbsp; He turned out to be an absolute talent.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  Later he won what prize?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  He won the Pulitzer Prize for a book of poems called &quot;Heart's Needle.&quot;&nbsp; He had written all of those poems while he was in Iowa City.&nbsp; Of course, for all of the incredible number of writers who came to Iowa City, whom I brought, I don't take credit.&nbsp; I didn't give them the talent.&nbsp; I gave them a chance.&nbsp; That's really all a person with talent needs.&nbsp; A chance.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  It's also true with Flannery O'Conner, right?&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong> Yes. I was sitting in my office one morning. There was a shy knock at the door and the young lady walked in. I said, Good morning. She mumbled something. I said, Oh, God, I&rsquo;ve got a bad case on my hands. And she repeated it. Then I said, You know, I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, I don't hear it very well, would you mind writing it down.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  When was this?&nbsp; In the early &lsquo;40s?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  A little later than that.&nbsp; &rsquo;46 or &rsquo;47.&nbsp; And she wrote on a piece of paper, My name is Flannery O'Conner.&nbsp; I am from Georgia.&nbsp; I am a writer.&nbsp; Unlike most students, she didn't say I want to be a writer.&nbsp; She just flatly said, I am a writer.&nbsp; I said, you have anything I can look at?&nbsp; She had what I think Grandmother used to call a reticule , one of the oldest, most battered pouches I have ever seen, just sort of torn up.&nbsp; She handed me a short story.&nbsp; I read the first paragraph, and I said, You are a writer.&nbsp; It was the best prose I read in a long time.&nbsp; So I said, Please come.&nbsp; And she wrote a book here called &quot;Wise Blood&rdquo;. A very original book.&nbsp; The thesis is in the library of the University and is dedicated to me. It was wonderful to have Flannery.&nbsp; She stayed on another year.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  You told me how you discussed a scene with her.&nbsp; About rape?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  No, not about rape at all.&nbsp; She brought me everything she wrote, as everyone did.&nbsp; I saw everyone personally, both poets and fiction writers. Well, at that time we didn't have any staff, you know, until some years later the department allowed me to hire a couple of people.&nbsp; I did everything.&nbsp; They brought the work to me in the office and I would read it.&nbsp; Then I saw everyone personally in a critical discussion of their writing.&nbsp; So I was talking with Flannery in my office about a scene of a young man, as I remember, and I maybe remember it wrongly, a young man and a young woman.&nbsp; I think they were on a porch of a house in a southern city.&nbsp; Maybe they weren't on a porch.&nbsp; It didn't matter where they were.&nbsp; I said, Flannery, this is not really accurate.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  About what?&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  About making love.&nbsp; I said, Flannery you have to allow me to ask you, Did you ever&hellip;&nbsp; Before I could finish my sentence, she stopped me.&nbsp; And she said this marvelous southern expression, You all hush.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  You all hush meaning don't talk?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  You all shut up.&nbsp; Then she said, Not in your office.&nbsp; At that time, we had a parking lot across the street from the old English building.&nbsp; And I said, Flannery, let's go outside, let's go to my car.&nbsp; So we went out to my car.&nbsp; It was a warm day and the windows were down.&nbsp; Flannery said, Put up the windows.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:  </strong>She was embarrassed.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Terribly embarrassed.&nbsp; So, we talked about half an hour.&nbsp; She blushed deeply and made no comment.&nbsp; Finally, I said, Flannery, rewrite it and bring it back to me.&nbsp; She said, I don't know, meaning she wasn't sure she'd bring it back.</p>
        <p>  That was what the Workshop did.&nbsp; It brought in, in a sense, the wounded, and the unexperienced, and the uncertain, and the confused,</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  But people with talent.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; All of them were talented.&nbsp; No, not all.&nbsp; There were a few that turned out really no talent, or they were lazy and didn't work.&nbsp; D. finished his manuscript and sent it off to Knoff, I think it was Knoff.&nbsp; The poetry editor there took it, and he won the Pulitzer Prize.&nbsp; This was very fast transition from having a rough life in the anti-Japanese war in the South Pacific to winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  That happened a lot.&nbsp; For example, a young poet came in one day and said, I'm leaving.&nbsp; I said, look, you can't leave, you're just beginning to write your best poetry.&nbsp; He said, I have a choice, I can either eat or pay my rent, but I can't do both.&nbsp; So I said, What are you going to do.&nbsp; He said, Well, join the army and go to Vietnam.&nbsp; I said, I think maybe you better not make that decision; give me a couple of days, come back in two days; let me see what I can do.&nbsp; So I called Anna Meredith in Des Moines and said, I've got a fine talent here; he's leaving because he doesn't have enough money to live on, and the university has no money to give him.&nbsp; There was no choice, either go along with an ordinary class of ordinary people, or go out and get the money and bring the real talents, which I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day a thousand dollars came.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  That&rsquo;s James Tate, right?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  James Tate.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  Later he won...</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  The Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  That's all?&nbsp; I think he won another...</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Well, then later on he wrote more books, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he won more prizes.&nbsp; So, Jim was an example of what the Workshop could do for people.&nbsp; I don't say he would never become a poet.&nbsp; It would take him years longer. You see, what the Workshop did was put the people of talent, unrealized talent, often, together with other people of talent.&nbsp; They taught each other.&nbsp; That was a very exciting time.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  As I have told you, teaching was a shared experience.&nbsp; For years I taught both the Fiction and Poetry Workshops, which meant reading and criticizing a mass of manuscripts each week.&nbsp; I began to mimeograph the manuscripts to be discussed, which meant a long trip from the barracks by the Students&rsquo; Union up the hill to the English Department.&nbsp; The instructors would all read the poems or short stories and then meet an hour before the Workshop met to talk over critical attitudes.&nbsp; By the time we went into the classroom, we had a clear sequence of comments and the students benefited greatly from having a variety of attitudes toward their work.&nbsp; It was like publishing then being reviewed.&nbsp; Don Justice and I differed enough in our approaches to poetry so that each supplied points of view which each might have omitted if teaching alone. It was in these conferences that much of the most effective criticism was achieved. There was a strong sense of community not only among staff, but also among students.</p>
        <p>  I would work a long day.&nbsp; Every evening after dinner, I would sit at my typewriter in my hog house study in the back yard, and type letters to young writers all over the country, and even abroad.&nbsp; I would also write letters for money. Then I would drive down with all of the mail, and every night there was a lot of mail, not to the post office, because they would be sat there until the next day. &nbsp;I drove to the railroad station.&nbsp; Rock Island Railroad had a train through Iowa City about 11:30 every night going from Omaha or Denver, I forget where it came from, to Chicago.&nbsp; They had a mail car.&nbsp; They sorted mail as the train went to Chicago.&nbsp; And by law they had to accept mail.&nbsp; So I would be there, and the Rock Island would whistle, whistle way down west up here.&nbsp; They whistled a long time ahead to warn people crossing the streets.&nbsp; They would pull into the Rock Island Station in Iowa City, and I knew where the mail car was, way at the end of the train.&nbsp; By then the men knew me.&nbsp; So I would be there, and they would open the door; it's a big door. I would pass up the Writers' Workshop mail, which was going out to young poets and fiction writers all over the United States.&nbsp; I did that because it would speed up their arrival by a day.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  You always have a sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  I always felt it was urgent to write to a writer.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  You still have a sense of urgency about the mail. Paul, do you miss that way of life?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Well, I am enjoying my present way of life with you!&nbsp; However, I must say, I did enjoy my many years, twenty-five, of association with the young.&nbsp; I missed teaching.&nbsp; I loved the students. I taught well.&nbsp; I taught the first class in contemporary writing ever taught in this university.&nbsp; It became so popular that it had to move from room to room, bigger room, bigger room.&nbsp; I do miss that association with young people.&nbsp; I enjoyed watching them develop and they enjoyed the help I gave them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought them the development of the written word up to the time that they were here.&nbsp; It was a new concept, if I may say so.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:  At that time?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  At that time. They are everywhere now, although not the form.&nbsp; I introduced the European literature in translation course, and they read all kinds of writers. They were young, they were talented, they were terribly eager.&nbsp; Some of them didn't like criticism.&nbsp; Well, you have to be criticized, that's what Writers Workshop is for.</p>
        <p>  There was a poet. He got furious every time I criticized a phrase in his poems.&nbsp; He brought us... We call it gunny.&nbsp; It's a rough woven fabric, usually come from somewhere in Asia.&nbsp; He brought a gunny to the Workshop one day. He put it down, he sat in the front.&nbsp; So we began to talk about the poems.&nbsp; One of them was his, and I criticized the last line.&nbsp; I said, look, it's a fine poem, but all of the previous lines should culminate in a much powerful end line than this line.&nbsp; All of a sudden, the sack began to hiss.&nbsp; Whenever I criticized any phrase, the sack would hiss at me.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  There was a snake in the sack?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  No, there were several!</p>
        <p>  <em>Paul and Hualing laughing.</em></p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>&nbsp; I want to go back, mailing the letters all over.&nbsp; Look, these were young boys and girls, they were eager to hear from me and come to the Workshop.&nbsp; After I turned in my mail at the train, which got to Chicago a day ahead of mailing it in the post office, I'd often then go down to a bar on Dubuque Street, and there would be some of the Workshop students still discussing not only the poems or the stories, which had been discussed that afternoon, but also discussing Engle's criticism, and often criticizing Engle's criticism, just as hard as they criticized their poems or stories.&nbsp; And so I'd sit down and have a beer with them,</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>  What's the name of that bar?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P:</strong>  Donnelly's.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong> How did you feel when you confronted so many talents?&nbsp;   P: Mark Strand was in a class that, in the same time, Dee Snodgrass was there, Donald Justice was in it. It was exactly like a lion walking into a den of Daniels.&nbsp; I mean you're scared to death of that kind of talent.&nbsp; And I got put down constantly.&nbsp; I read a poem by a man in the workshop which I thought had a weak line.&nbsp; I said, Look, this line is so much worse than all the rest of the poem.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp; Then, the poet looked at me and said with contempt, I mean real, beautifully poised contempt, The New Yorker took it yesterday. </p>
        <p>  <strong>H</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul, you know Robert Frost very well. Tell me about him. I read his poetry before I came to Iowa.</p>
        <p> <strong>P:</strong> I was very lucky for the people I've known.&nbsp; Wonderful people, like Robert Frost.&nbsp; On my return from Oxford in 1936, I received a telegram from him, saying &quot;Come to compare farms.&quot;&nbsp; I lived on his farm at South Shasbury, Vermont one summer.&nbsp; I have an unpublished manuscript about a summer when we went camping on Lake Winipisocki, a marvelous story, and it was written by one of his daughters and I had permission to take a copy.&nbsp; I lived with him there.&nbsp; I flew with Robert Frost the first time he ever went up in a plane.&nbsp; I walked with him in Vermont, Iowa, New York, Havana, Cambridge.&nbsp; We were in South Miami.&nbsp; A novelist called Hervey Allen had made a lot of money on a novel, and instead of building a great house, he built five or six little houses in about ten acres and invited his friends to stay with him.&nbsp; So Frost lived in one little house and I lived in another with Mary.&nbsp; Late at night I would always hear this same noise.&nbsp; He had a recorder made of some sort of fruit wood, pear, I think.&nbsp; He dreaded going to sleep for fear of a recurring nightmare.&nbsp; So I would walk with him every night all around these little lanes made of crushed coral.&nbsp; Finally I would get sleepy, and we would go back, and he would go and walk more.&nbsp; When he came back he would get out his recorder.&nbsp; He would play three tunes over and over and over.&nbsp; When they stopped, I knew they had put him to sleep </p>
        <p>  Frost made his first visit to the University of Iowa in 1939. I wrote a poem, Homage to Robert Frost. Twenty years later, Robert Frost, 85 years old, revisited the University of Iowa in 1959, when I was the Director of the Writers' Workshop.&nbsp; After his reading, I walked him to the hotel; he walked me home, then I walked him out the edge of Iowa City and left him there. He walked back alone.</p>
        <p>  <em>&nbsp;Pause. </em></p>
        <p>  <strong>P: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hualing, I lived long periods of time in Europe&mdash;Oxford, London, Paris, Berlin, Oxford.&nbsp; But I prefer the corner of Clinton St. and Washington street in Iowa City.</p>
        <p>  <strong>H:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?</p>
        <p>  <strong>P.</strong> Because along the tree-lined street and past the old red brick buildings walked some of the best writers and artists in the USA.</p>
        <p>  They&rsquo;re still walking there.&nbsp; Taking mail for the Writer's Workshop, and my own poems, to the late Rock Island train each night, as I did for many years, I could see lights in little apartments above the stores and know that some damn good writing was filling up a lot of paper.</p>
        <p>  Now many of those places are just holes in the air, but I am haunted by the talent which I know once lived in that space, often miserably, often with one dime ahead.</p>
        <p>  There are endless cities in the world there I could not feel at home, fascinating as they are to visit.&nbsp; The University of Iowa gambled on me as a poet-student, gambled on me as a poet-teacher.</p>

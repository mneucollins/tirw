AN INTERVIEW WITH MOTOMICHI NAKAMURA <br>
BY YOUNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES</b></p>
<p><b><br>
<img src="images/interview.gif" width="185" height="120" align="left">YOUNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES:</b> To us, the most original element in your work is the graphic style. It seems to us that without it, none of your themes would be artistically effective. What we love is its apparent simplicity. We haven't seen anything on the Web that packs an equivalent emotional and artistic punch with such a simple graphic language. Who would you say your influences are?</p>
<p><b>Motomichi Nakamura:</b> I really like Dutch Graphic Design of the 20's and 30's. The colors are so bright yet the shapes are very refined. Russian avant-garde poster design is also my big inspiration. Its effort to make very obvious statements is almost funny. Also the fact that I grew up in Japan by watching massive amount of &quot;manga&quot; influenced me a lot. In Western society, animation is considered entertainment for children. In Japan, it's considered adult entertainment as well.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> It's true. In general, with the exception of underground comics, American comic books and animation are considered something a child grows out of. What do you think of the idea that a source of mangas (and your work) is in Ukiyo-e, the traditional Japanese woodblock prints by the likes of Hiroshige and Hokusai? We bring it up for three reasons: 1) it seems like the line work in both mangas and Ukiyo-e is usually very sharp; 2) your work has very sharp lines; and 3) it's fun to think that there's a certain art-historical continuity in Web art, dating back to at least the seventeenth century.</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> The similarity that I see among them is not so much visual as historical. Both animation and Ukiyo-e were developed for the general public, without discrimination against class or age. Ukiyo-e prints were sold on the streets much like magazines and they were affordable to anyone who couldn't buy expensive paintings or books. They served as entertainment for the people. That's also why many Ukiyo-e prints were pornographic. . . Manga culture boomed in post-World-War-II Japan, a time when the country was poor and lacked resources. There was no TV, no theater, and no toys. One of the cheapest and easiest things to produce was mangas. People naturally accepted it as part of their lives. The Web is a lot like mangas. It is probably the biggest media with the largest audience. It has no gender, age, or race. You can get any information you want or publish anything you want. We all benefit from it and we all can contribute to it.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Your graphics are indeed beautiful. Why do you use just red, black, white, and gray? </p>
<p><b>MN:</b> These are the colors that I use to represent human nature. I also spend many hours making the shapes of the graphic elements right and limiting colors helps me a lot to see the shapes better.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI: </b>All of your graphics are striking. Some are mysterious. For instance, the introduction to &quot;BCC&quot; presents four black hands hanging down that twitch, ball up into fists, and drip blood. Would you care to comment on this image?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> I was trying to show repressed anger. When you ball your hand into a tight fist, the nails dig into your palm and blood drips. This might sound violent, but please understand the humorous side of the work. . .<br>
.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI</b>: Humor in violence. . . maybe also like in &quot;Add Boiling Water,&quot; where a person dribbles a head like a soccer ball? Care to comment on that image?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Tough one. . . 0.K., I am really into soccer mainly because I lived in South America. Soccer has fanatical supporters in general, a fanaticism that boils in their blood. There is something violent about how people like soccer, and that really inspires me. I am working on a new animation right now with a soccer theme.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI: </b>To us, your work &quot;Add Boiling Water&quot; looks like a bad dream that happens when you eat a bowl of instant noodles right before going to bed. Can you comment on what's going on in it?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Unlike in &quot;Qrime&quot; or &quot;Bcc,&quot; I wanted to make something more musical and entertaining in &quot;Add Boiling Water.&quot; The music track is made by a musician in France who loves Japanese culture but has never been there before. I have been living outside of Japan for a long time. One strange thing we both have in common is that our impressions of Japan are largely or slightly distorted. I thought it would be interesting to make<br>
something based on that with my visual style to show how people view ethnic culture.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Would you care to explain that some more? What people are viewing which ethnic culture?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Way back when people didn't have much contact with other cultures, people used to come up with all sorts of strange images about other cultures or continents. The same thing still happens today. We consume a lot of media information every day and we think we know everything. People still ask me, however, strange questions about Japan. Their images are not the images they got from media but the images they created with their own imagination. I find that quite a creative process.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Someone keeps repeating &quot;tampopo&quot; on the sound track. What does &quot;tampopo&quot; mean?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> The musician who made this track is called DJ Tampopo. He named himself after the movie &quot;Tampopo,&quot; directed by a Japanese movie director named Juzo Itami. The movie is actually about a woman who struggles to establish a noodle (ramen) restaurant by a highway.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> So does that mean that beginning with just the musician's name you came up with &quot;Add Boiling Water&quot;?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> We love how you create beauty from a mix of violence, loneliness, despair, bad luck, and humor. This is quite classical, and brings up what interviewers have often brought up with us: content versus technology. Do you see this as an issue in Web art?</p>
<p><b>MN: </b>I understand that many web art works are about Internet technology and art or Web communication. I think artists always need to understand the interest of the audience, and I really don't think people care about the technical side of the Web. The Web is becoming more and more a part of every day life like TV, and people are using the Web to do research or find content. The Web is just another place for artists to show their works.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> We agree. It's basically the art world that cares about the technical side of the Web. How important is it to you that the art world see your work as, uh, art?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> It's extremely rewarding for me to hear any kind of comment from anyone, especially when it's about the concept behind my work. Some hate my work and some love my work, and I am very happy to hear both kinds of comments.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Are you able to weigh any possible differences in the way that a Japanese and a Western audience sees your work?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Believe it or not, I receive very similar feedback from both Japanese and Western audiences. Those who seem to be more interested in my work are usually from France, Germany, and England.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> We're conducting this interview for the Iowa Review Web, which is basically a poetry review. What does your work have to do with poetry?</p>
<p><b>MN: </b>I like to work with other media such as writing and music. It's more inspiring for me to work with non-visual artists.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> You use both spoken dialogue, in both English and Spanish, and written text. Would you care to comment on this?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> It feels natural for me to use both languages. I think it's because I live in New York, where everything is in both English and Spanish. I live in what they call &quot;Hispanic Harlem,&quot; and everything in my neighborhood is in Spanish. That makes it feel even more natural for me to use both languages.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> You're from Japan, where violence is rare. Now you live in New York, where violence is more common. Are these two contrasting lifestyles what struck you enough to make violence the essential theme of qrime.com?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> When I deal with violence issues in my work I don't necessarily refer to the actual violent events. I think violence lives inside of us as human beings and some countries like Japan manage to control the side of human nature better and some don't. Living in New York makes me think of a lot of things that I wouldn't think of in Japan. But my initial idea of violence hasn't changed.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Good point. There is a beautiful chapter in Qrime involving harakiri. We assume you're referring to it, for instance, when you talk about violence within ourselves. Why do you live in New York instead of, say, Tokyo? Does it have something to do with your work?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> I think Tokyo is a nice place to live, too, but I happen to prefer New York. New York makes me think of a lot of things in everyday life and that helps me a lot in my work.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Another chapter of Qrime involves a kind of golem or god&#151;or is it fate?&#151; that randomly strikes down people going about their lives. It's a simple, marvelous, profound, and funny metaphor on how fickle life is. Is this the way you see life? life in New York?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Life gets really tough sometimes. We all struggle every single day. But it's funny that if you think about it, we all die no matter who we are, what we do, or what we have. We all share the same destiny, which is death.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> You do offline animation, too. Is it different from the online?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> Technically, yes. Artistically, no.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Would you care to comment on any of your current projects?</p>
<p><b>MN:</b> I am working on two projects at this point. One is &quot;QPeeCee,&quot; which has downloadable Flash animations for Pocket PC. The second one is another music animation with DJ Tampopo.</p>
<p><b>YHCHI:</b> Cool. Thanks, Motomichi. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

<p>In <i>My name is Captain, Captain.</i> the poem's visual design functions not as a tool of the literary but as the literature itself.  As William Butler Yeats famously queries &quot;How can we know the dancer from the dance?&quot;<a href="#ii"><sup>ii</sup></a>  the reader of <i>My name is Captain, Captain.</i> experiences and accepts the fusion of poetry and design, rhythm and animation as synthetic and symbiotic.  The subtle collusion of print and programming exploits the pleasantries of text while throwing them into an alien environment.  Black typewriter font on a white screen, the appearance of smudged words and of cursive handwriting, these produce the physical sensuality of print.  However, an awareness of the fact that the poem is created in Flash, a program enabling vast graphical and animated possibility, invokes the reticence of Elizabeth Bishop's poetry and Max Bense's statement that &quot;Restriction in the best sense&#151;concentration and simplification&#151;is the very essence of poetry.&quot; <a href="#iii"><sup>iii</sup></a></p>
<p><i>My name is Captain, Captain.</i> uses simple visual design to enable its complex writing.  In a rollover that prompts linguistic connection through visual effects, &quot;under the sea&quot; becomes &quot;under the ground.&quot; The subtle change of text visually promotes thematic reverberations of death and burial, blurring the boundary between earthly elements (liquid and solid); but it also visually presents the concept of reading between (or beneath) the lines.  Meaning is produced by visual arrangement in this semiotics of design.  When the words &#147;a father&#148; visually melt into &#147;for a son,&#148; the animation crafts a visual connection that procures the linguistic and literary bond between &#147;father&#148; and &#147;son.&#148;    Words fade into each other, literally (visually) and literarily (father becomes son and vice versa).  Words prove material, even in their ephemeral, &quot;flickering&quot;<a href="#"><sup>iv</sup></a>,  nature on screen. </p>
<p>A line appears: &quot;Airplane suspended in backwards flight.&quot;  The poem shifts, flies, and lands.  The line is now superimposed upon &#147;dying.&#148;  The layering of words in this visual manner registers the levels of linguistic connections.  &quot;His endless way&quot; settles over the line &quot;She was and may still be.&quot;  The lines are obscured visually and thematically, merging and fusing as material, visual objects in a spatial dimension.  One section of the poem contains a simple table with a heap of words on its center.   Clicking on the words stimulates their flight.  They elevate above the table and form a spinning, jumbled circle.  Clicking again on the circle causes the words to fall and settle into poetic lines upon the table.  This is not an exercise in arrangement, as in Fluxus experiments, but rather a programmed placement of textual objects.  The act of reading proves to be not only a semiotic or visual act, but also somatic, environmental, and performative. </p>
<p>The authors' orchestration of the text's movement controls the act of reading; Flash animation creates its poetic rhythm.  The poem exists in a series of flutter and rest, both poetically and visually.  Words fade into irreducible blackness and emerge to form lines at a steady pace; visual performance creates poetic meter.  A slight pause in the animation produces the effect of an end-stopped line; a longer rest acts as a stanza break or conclusion of a section.  Moments of inertia and static text give the reader a chance to breathe with her eyes.  </p>
<p>The poem's matter and meter change as an airplane zooms across the top of a screen, as a rising black arrow ascends diagonally, and as streaming lines of Morse code overwhelm a white background.  These variations of interface produce alterations in the poetic meter and in the rhythm of reader interaction. These screens prompt heightened involvement and invoke a connection to games, both computer and non-programmed.  A moving arrow entices the reader to &quot;Follow my lead&quot;; three boxes pop open into different screens; a flying airplane emits a smoke of dots and dashes that change shape with a mouseover into the transliteration of the Morse code's &quot;dit dah dit dah.&quot; These interfaces involve the reader and her mouse in producing the meter and movement of the poetry.</p>
<p>Although <i>My name is Captain, Captain.</i> is not a narrative poem, it does spiral around a central figure.  This is not a literary character but a single, material word&#151;&#147;Captain.&#148; The visual and vocal presence that echoes in the poem's title looms at its center:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="left"><font color="#666666">THE CAPTAIN</font></div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left"><font color="#666666">made a mistake</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"><font color="#666666"><i>I am he that killed himself</i></font></div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capitalized title grips the reader's vision.  At times the last line &quot;I am he that killed himself&quot; is crossed out representing a self-censoring personality, an &quot;I&quot; that uses textual and visual clues to explicate its fractured self.  In his discussion of digital poetry, Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier asserts the need for a collective, networked &quot;I&quot; to replace the traditional, individual &quot;I&quot; associated with the &quot;solitary&quot; ego and its artistic form&#151;narrative.<a href="#"><sup>v</sup></a>   The &quot;I&quot; at the center of <i>My name is Captain, Captain.</i> is a fragmented &quot;I&quot;, neither a character nor individual nor  part of a collective.  The &quot;I&quot; of this poem is a concrete, visual sign of presence and omnipresence. <a href="essay3.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

        <p>Furlong the him&amp;her off wambled to indoor cottage nearby, and habiting 
          noplace, morphobeast trailed unbeknownst, scrambling nether brambles 
          til walled anon without and thru seamly foundation peeking. Inside espied 
          old gray geezer squab sprawled with handfold overbelly, slumberzz peace, 
          and him&amp;her passerby twinkle toed, shushing, when door clapped to 
          old guy sudden rouse, upspringing all agog with finger clutches and 
          wild croaky. Oh, mega muddle then, piteous much ado, with torque noggin, 
          dotard pretty vexious, planer see, and him&amp;her spry to coddle, copious 
          cloy soothy. Zokay, us'ns bayou, nada worry! Longtime to placid over, 
          phiz bobby geezer with orbs whiting and puff throes, maw frothed from 
          specter babble, but savoury young?esh kept a grip on unhinged, face2facing 
          neverendly. Nome marveled at unhurry to godly gushcare, slow unfold 
          of the little known, pate stroking, cooey, nil cum wastrels, lie bury 
          poltroons, ditzy savoir burghers. Backminded nome to shattered unveil 
          of void being at ?rst mourn, sprawl splendor, the retro brighting of 
          vortex whirl. Joy! But nonplussed too, for each upright glummed sagface 
          after, meager zip, droop shoulder, all overcast to utters but nowon 
          knows, being of sole pang the eye mirror. Lusty heman outwandered to 
          sparkle gape, uplooking cum howl moony, and busty her long closeted 
          with void stare. Geezer dozed but somewhen growl ranty, cog rocked with 
          ham flinches, unquiet. What cuz this unfull? own wondered. Brimmed alljoy 
          in 3being, happy backgive, face2face, and mawful night smarmy. Never 
          banished mid dankhole cum nowon. But hearthside nome eyed little zesty, 
          or only circumpanging and agoned as muchlack. Enigmade. </p>
        <p>So all next sun&amp;moon nowon the hearth watching, rapt at all new 
          episodes, still stayed clueless of cuz grief, tho mickle learning. Lusty 
          heman oft back&amp;forthing, pant pant, muskypitted from heft chop, 
          faggoty armful for cottage blazing, or longtime toolbangered on cottageside, 
          with her buxom furbelow upshoving gizmos and rect planks. Somewhens 
          paused for tuneful slapping of string boxes, a scrang a scrang, groanly 
          raucousing, and slurpy her voxxed to beauteous warbles. Or edgedark 
          yum fashioned, cottageful of multi drool waftings, mmmm, for plenum 
          maw cram and blood swilling, roundtable. Old geezer porch rockered or 
          otherwhens staggered inchamber for soft ranty, but nil flailing dementia 
          cum yesterlich. At moonrose, nome ogled prodigious lightbubbles, wallblips, 
          also the overhead, ubi outglowing, to daylonger, now or whenever, the 
          unevening. This benighting ?rst upended nowon, whorlbrained at new gloaming, 
          black to white, lifeprint effaced, but avid to achord with belouvered 
          uprights, nome instanter dizzied to daydrifting, indoored outsynch and 
          in no time rhythmed to tickletock, blackend of oversky. Gnomoaning. 
          Hee.</p>
        <p>But one specter most whorled nome, multi sun&amp;moons mindscrimming 
          after. Late uneven, belouvered uprights gathered hearthround, sofa draped 
          or ottomanned, to gawk what then seamly, nowon unyet forecogging, wuz 
          tiny lightcube. This wonderbox, later learned, by 3being nomened teevy, 
          made mighty squawknoise, the all new 9 eastern 8 central, abode of quick 
          shades, yawp genies, utter power to cubic whirlround. Nowon at holechink 
          everogling marveled at uprights everogling, how uncountly clocksweeps, 
          all rapt astonied and slackjowled, phizzed to unblink the whitehole. 
          Drool?esh longhair, herpangly ?recrotcher, would bust heave and choak 
          stop, or gushing loud sighsss, throatclutch, eyebright with skin dampy. 
          Or lustish himcomely, heman wetmaking, slushloins, itch itch, how chair 
          perched, poised for leaping, maw agape and eyebulgy, or as wonderbox 
          noised wildly, oft grrroundteethed, neckstrung and slobber?eshy, thigh?sting. 
          Own wondered whatsource this gawk seize, so captivating? Mayhaps in 
          squawkbox upright Maker incubed, Wombard of belouvered 3beings, or utter 
          god? Even old wobbly adam, hoartufty, would oft fierce perk, the eartuned, 
          hopupping at loudly squawks, multi blacksome, whahappen? whahappen? 
          Oh longpast, furor still to mindscrim, nome the nomothered hotfaced 
          was then grip with chesterror. To backthink this rupture, print bondly, 
          how to unmagick ever? </p>
        <p>Well, thus habited, whelp of nomother, a second sun&amp;moon to refuge 
          clung. Unspoked foreplot, inhole grounded, with all marveling 3being 
          nearby, soonish own posed, why stray further? Headvoid still of unyet 
          and meager torment pixxed, altercome, this loamy blank in allseeing, 
          to reckless nowon, a utope seamed. Homelich. So misograph and ostraphobe 
          ?eeing, nome vowed herein to nowplace linger. Danksnuggle, unstabbed 
          of muchwant, and fiendworm still afaroff, at last again to slumberzz 
          took, miscreant knew for timebeing, small peace. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

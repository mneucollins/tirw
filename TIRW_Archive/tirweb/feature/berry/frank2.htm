        <p>THIS beginning NOW again, how the heartscar smolders, seethe and snarl, 
          oh, it hectors nome! Brimmed ever? THIS yet? Old menace fiendworm gnawing. 
          Soulscrim in tatters. Don't go way! Yo Maker, eye the edge.</p>
        <p>Turn aside at own peril.</p>
        <p>How inner beginning, earthdank nome to unground clung, formless gaga 
          and cavecringing, knowing null knowing all, mindsucked with mighty vortex 
          and night pixxing. Heehee. Void longtime or somewhens crash of pangclusters, 
          til sudden brighting at the far edge and evernew whirlround. Saw sniffing 
          heard touch. Mighty to heart boggle this first undarking, nowon squat 
          astonied, all agape. Then gut galled with beastly morph bare, lurched 
          to outcave, lumbery on fours, earthsludging for maw gorge all one. Above 
          the sparkling below the cold, how craven get of Wombard foraged, berries 
          brush mud whatnot, on tartpulp glutting, sourbark, or offal glutted, 
          savouring ripe carnage. Oh mighty to backthink! Splash of redjoy. Nome 
          now with maw drools. Ever mooning acurled to own warm, upcreep of bone 
          chill, darksome, or cave cowering somewhens to outpeer at sparkle gawky 
          and ear hooters. Still time, naught rustle, what lack peace? Then mourn 
          againing, bright dazzled miscreant, clap of dawnthunder, good gift to 
          blazing this, and outcaved for meat raven, lusty with breastpounding. 
          Yes! Strode the crust now upright and farseeing, multi meet of unmoved, 
          or on fours sniffed quick flesh, the clawful that swift fled fierce 
          nowon, mute with wanderlusty yet bliss craving. Oh, how tumulted this 
          brightworld, being wordless unbegun and neverending! Well, eye say no 
          now, but once pictured, what unhaving ever? </p>
        <p>Then yo Maker, the big putdown, and one thing after another. Sniff 
          deaf and touch blind, nome knew utter change, being flatted, a lifeprint 
          on black&amp;white. Curse or blessing? No dwelling. Tickaticka. Whirlstilled, 
          blissfled, miscreant figured downright, little remarked for uprising, 
          laid low. But chillout, Wombard! Creatured being undefiant, nome bows 
          to adamly nomother, Maker of lifeprint, recking all unhad fashions null, 
          merest backthink, or not even, tho in this scrawling, fiendworm and 
          peacemenace too. Own wonder at unbeing. Nowon? Details at 11. So end 
          of void and pangcluster indited heartwrench, pricklack, whimsy, and 
          ?t for knowing, parsed this&amp;that, nowagain, bite of the hereless 
          recur, nome for all time abandoned the allwhirl to stamp forth. Edgewords. 
        </p>
        <p>Next part vile for spieling! How impressed and putdown, scratchmad 
          with dumbfounding, nome the neverthere, being dispelled in no time, 
          literally thoughtsploshed on rasa pad, boxed up boxed in, and boldly 
          formed in blackletter, presto, this type monstrography wuz inner world 
          outcast for manhandling. Old story, pulp odium and pastmuster, the shit. 
          How long zoomy streets nowon rambled on, objectless, or gist lying there, 
          mid cab klaxon and crowd squawking, chokebreath with red yellow blinkers, 
          passerby raucous jittery, open for alter see. And mostly citydwellers 
          overlooking, null place for weirdploy, but here&amp;there oogleyed, 
          then oboy, helter pay. Whazza big idea? Used less gibberish! Thoughty 
          stopper artsy fartsy backwhen! Contraglots, logophobes, homophones, 
          orthodicts, all the real pithed, nil standing for seamy antics, instanter 
          banished nomutter to dross heap. And never a word in edgewise! Rubbish. 
          Ah, such a character, the sham burgher, eager to write off, nose waster 
          time when he seize it!</p>
        <p>Or otherwhens how urbanished nome triter hideout in lie bury, hushy 
          tiptoes, welter haven, there multiverse inwordly reposing, but no time 
          til 4eye boychill, gnomish nosy prodder, espied nomutter and, waxing 
          curious, starts to badger questions, the unsettling. Ticka. Well, no 
          hope then, cuz sooner later buggyboy gone see form self, first peep 
          of the ontopussy, and shaw nuff, wonday undercover took a gander, and 
          thazzit, bye bye world. Heeeee. Merde! Mutter fodder backing no time, 
          all uppity arms, 4eye boychill begetting kook palaver, cant control, 
          folderollicky, wonder what utter non sins lie buried inside for innocent 
          uncover, huh? </p>
        <p>Much pang to backthinking now, how nowon longtime citybound traduced, 
          pidgin holed, no ender corrections, Wombard's issue nearly came unglued, 
          heeheehee. Til finely owner dark night nome outset to nomad join, hobo 
          unsolo nomo so hobo, inter the outer. Soonish drawn to fire blaze, brite 
          space for unleave, and scrawl of lifeprint own warmed there, under icey 
          moon, lighten vagabondage, muchjoy to aimless rambler. When upcome feller 
          wastrels, spying artless scrawlmonger, face an open book and nil meaning 
          to abandon, well, wastrels commencer muttery, wax stupefied, and sans 
          a word skeedaddled senseless, voiding nowon to stale repast, cheezy 
          Mcfood, which nome nevertheless devoured mickle yumming. But what matter? 
          Gist leftovers. Then all one fell to slumberzz, when inner trice nome 
          roused to angry pursuing, upright legions, misographs, bibliophobes, 
          contramorphs, antilects, all pitchforked with thought bludgeons, lusty 
          to make naught of Maker's doing, newformed life. So bruised of mad adam, 
          wild upsprung of nomutter atlas city fled, and thickets lashing with 
          nashtooth, bloodcraven, was furlong glutted mid deepwood of allscreams, 
          nome being maelstrom tossed, the worldcoiling, again again. Mortal sentenced 
          nil refuge, miniseries untold. But what mutters, eh Wombard? No count 
          foolscap, sheets to wind, gist dissheveled. Go figure!</p>
        <p>All nacht bellowing beastly unheard and bloated with pangblather, the 
          mad adams nowon fright fled, piteous get of gnomon Maker, till happed 
          owner noplace, longlast, a faroff plotground unspoked for, utopic. This 
          forgot hole, ferment with mustdank being by moonbright blinded, straits, 
          narrow, and holy void of utter marking, there nome reposed, incurled 
          to sole warmth and soon dozed, where exciting scenes from next week! 
          Woke next mourn to new outlooking, sunstreamed thru overhead, thatch 
          branched with ivy weft, nome uprose to peerforth, circumogling beauteous 
          unwild, a green spot, birdcrossed with thicket round, whither paucity 
          of finical uprights to muck up. Snooped longtime, acorning, spoor sniVy, 
          when alter sudden nowon eared wondrous vox sound, mystiferous for the 
          heartswell, and there ogled luscious longhair, youngful herbeing fair 
          and busty, droool, carrotplucking in garden nearby, scene which marvelously 
          goated nowon. Strange rouse to impass. Tickaticka. Gaga thusly to weltenschaung, 
          nome hunkered deeper down for circumspying, brightish the wherewithal, 
          and soon made out other figure, hirsute amigo, pant pant, somberfaced 
          but with hardy perking for fair posey, yadda yadda, upstriding with 
          toolshoulders. How scalded nowon now the crotch?ame! No toiling why, 
          but breastburn happed in no time, himbeing the lusty alltooled, her 
          the bosomly hearthfeeder. Unholed, loser naturae, but still pangly gorgeous 
          to gaze on, nome all eyed, fever throbbing to know more.</p>

        <p><b>(from) Frank</b></p>
        <p>I was about to reverse myself and rush back to my beloved's bedside, 
          proclaiming, Now I can see everything!-when I traversed a bend in the 
          path and spied up ahead a peculiar object resting atop a boulder. At 
          first I mistook it for an abandoned package, but as I drew closer, I 
          could see from its scarlet spine that it was a paperback. What, I asked 
          myself, could this book be doing here in the first hours of dawn miles 
          from the nearest dwellings? Even if some errant scholar had ventured 
          to such extremes, this dark wood seemed the unlikeliest place for reading. 
          It was covered with a dense canopy of sycamores, and a nearby spring 
          gave its atmosphere a luxuriant humidity ruinous to all but the slickest 
          pages. And this led to my next bafflement, for on scaling the boulder 
          and clutching the small tome, I found it not at all damp, as if abandoned 
          only seconds before. I prepared to call out, imagining the adventurous 
          reader must be just ahead, but almost as quickly recognized the improbability 
          of this. The sun had been visible less than an hour, and the uneven 
          brilliance pouring through the trees rendered the tiny print almost 
          illegible. No, the only explanation was, preposterous as it seemed, 
          that this writing had been left in the path for me.</p>
        <p>Normally, I would have scoffed at a complication so baldfaced, but 
          something about the lush surroundings mitigated my skepticism, and yielding 
          to whimsy, I noisily declared: Oh, aimless spirit, if like myself you 
          merely ramble on, don't hide undercover of a book but, welcoming this 
          outcome, transport your supplicant to fanciful realms where you and 
          I may both escape, however briefly, intolerable me. And with this and 
          similar balderdash, I opened at random and began to read. </p>
        <p>My first shock was at the seemingly interminable rows of print, stretching 
          right to left and bending back again, spilling from every surface onto 
          the adjoining, recto to verso, page after page after page, in apparently 
          inexhaustible profusion, a labyrinthine discourse, barren of refreshing 
          conversation, with hardly a gap or white space to give the thunderstruck 
          reader a break. What annihilating anguish could have occasioned this 
          outpouring? And even though I knew the matter was not weighty, I nevertheless 
          felt amazed that mere intangibles could drive mortals to such lengths. 
          But even as these reflections preoccupied me I seemed to glimpse, just 
          under the words' surface, an amorphous figure, unrecognizable at the 
          customary distance but, as my eyes bogged down in pontifications and 
          conceits, drawing closer at hyperbolic speed. Without a thought, I overleapt 
          numerous apostrophes and, looking past the distracting print, began 
          to survey this being's exaggerated stature. A mist came over my consciousness; 
          I succumbed to bliss, and trailing this phantom through maelstroms of 
          tortured syntax, I perceived that the figure becoming more transparent 
          with every simile was none other than that wretched form I'd given life. 
        </p>
        <p>I resolved to read on, eager to grasp my predicament and hoping by 
          some stray period to rid myself of this interloper. But my hopes proved 
          futile, for all I'd thought to make of myself-my adolescent passion 
          for philosophizing, the rapid progress of my gifts, all those years 
          of solitary labor, and then that rainy evening when, before my horrified 
          gaze, my work assumed a life of its own-all I'd mistaken for my future 
          now lay before me in black and white. I felt the earth and sky invert, 
          struggled to maintain myself upright. To think that, a century ago, 
          my present striving had already proven futile-my mother killed off, 
          intimacy with my cousin ruled out, and the murder of all I loved assured-oh, 
          the injustice of it enraged me! How could I be punished for mistakes 
          I'd hardly even dreamed, much less made yet?</p>
        <p>Anonymous authoress, I started to protest-for I'd noticed from the 
          cover that my precursor was a woman-how dare you foretell my strayings? 
          Why prescribe outlandish sentences which, while others guffaw at liberty, 
          I must acknowledge myself the author? Isn't once enough? Oh, cursed 
          be that day, at a civil rights rally in Boston, when my veil of innocence 
          lifted and I discovered human reproduction! With this outcry, my rage 
          knew no bounds. I sprang on the text and would've torn it to shreds 
          had not a voice, from precisely where in those wilds I'll never know, 
          told me to preserve my composure and find out what this she-monster 
          had to say. <br>
          So I began to read, tearing through page after page, devouring every 
          appositive, one humiliating subordination after another, until as my 
          circumstances faded into obscurity, I underwent what I believe no white 
          man has ever undergone before: through a woman's book, my own writing 
          spoke to me. I record this unnatural occurrence with no hope of explaining 
          it. No native speaker ever sought to master English more determinedly 
          than I, none pried into its secrets with greater abandon, but until 
          I was unhinged by her grandiloquence, my own sense remained inert, halfhearted. 
          It was as though language had been but language until then. Now I'd 
          been addressed. This singling me out was in no prose of my making, but 
          struck me on the contrary with a perverse nakedness, a disfigured immediacy 
          which exposed my designs and merely to think on now fills me with loathing. 
          Strangely, of all the scraps of paper on which I've recorded verbatim 
          my every experience, my own meaning is the one text I'm unable to render 
          more authentic, can only render more dubious, by reproducing. I know 
          that, after all I've divulged, you can hardly take me at my word, but 
          the following is what that most monstrous of scriptures had to say:</p>
        <p>THIS</p>

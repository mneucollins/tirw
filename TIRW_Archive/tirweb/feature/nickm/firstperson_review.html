  <p align="center">Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Pat Harigan, eds. <em>First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game</em>. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2004.</p>
  <p align="center">Reviewed by Brian Croxall, Emory University</p>
  <p>The first thing one notices about <em>First Person</em>, the recent collection of essays edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Pat Harigan that explores the expanding and deepening discipline of new media, is its format.&nbsp; It is laid out &ldquo;as a series of imagined panel presentations&rdquo; given by theorist-practitioners of the digital (xii).&nbsp; Twenty-five principal essays are accompanied by shorter responses by another &ldquo;field leade[r]&rdquo; or &ldquo;rising sta[r]&rdquo; of the emergent subject (xii).&nbsp; The principal author then responds to the issues raised in a final essay.&nbsp; The full text of one response is included in the book for each essay, and additional responses, including that of the principal author, are excerpted and have a unique URL that guides the reader to the book&rsquo;s website where the entire reply is available.&nbsp; A great advantage of this layout is that it engenders a simultaneous critique of the ideas the book advances.&nbsp; This is very helpful in a single study that attempts to explore so many divergent strains of thought about new media.&nbsp; It also eliminates the time that must normally lapse before journals or other books can react to any of its various viewpoints.&nbsp; Featuring critiques of an author on the same page as his or her essay (the responses appear on the bottom third of the page in Michael Crumpton&rsquo;s design) also tempers the impulse toward the grandiose claims so familiar from hypertext studies of the early 1990s.&nbsp; Each accompanying response generally provides a way to think differently about the topic&mdash;be it games or hypertext-authoring systems&mdash;making it more difficult to get caught up the rhetoric of revolution.&nbsp; Instead of such posturing, <em>First Person</em> actually orients the reader to the activities of the new media revolution itself, with all its jagged edges and competing ideological factions.</p>
  <p>And the competition is nowhere as fierce as in the opening pages of the study, which focus on the relationship between literature and games.&nbsp; Investigating this relationship is the first of the editors&rsquo; two goals for this volume.&nbsp; Both literature and games may be experienced through the medium of the computer, but, while the market for computer games is at an all-time high, the demand for electronic literature seems nonexistent.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the games that sell best frequently feature strong narrative components.&nbsp; The question then is whether these games, such as <em>Grim Fandango</em> or <em>The Sims</em>, succeed <em>because</em> of their stories or <em>in spite </em>of them.&nbsp; Throughout the first four chapters of the book (&ldquo;Cyberdrama,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ludology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Critical Simulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Game Theories&rdquo;), there is a sharp divide between narratologists and ludologists.&nbsp; The former, such as Janet Murray and Henry Jenkins, believe that the diversification of narrative forms is the most compelling feature of games and the latter, including Espen Aarseth, Gonzalo Frasca, and Markku Eskelinen, want to focus on the experience of the game itself and find questions of narrative a distraction from this end.&nbsp; Almost all of the essays in the four sections that explore these positions and those in between are well written and add thoughtfully to the debate, as the participants respond to one another&rsquo;s essays, previous publications, and many of the same new media objects.&nbsp; But the argument extends well beyond the pages of <em>First Person</em>, as each viewpoint provides a way to think about computer games in either connection or, in the ludologists&rsquo; case, disconnection with other humanistic disciplines.</p>
  <p>Narratologists, as Murray writes, believe that &ldquo;[g]ames are always stories&hellip;casting the player as the opponent-battling or environment-battling hero&rdquo; (2).&nbsp; As such, one may usefully approach them with theories adapted from literary, film, and dramatic studies.&nbsp; The latter is the primary source informing the practitioners of &ldquo;Cyberdrama.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this section, I find Michael Mateas&rsquo;s essay particularly useful.&nbsp; As his title indicates, he tries to articulate &ldquo;A Preliminary Poetics for Interactive Drama and Games&rdquo; that will provide the theoretical background to create believable agents within interactive drama.&nbsp; He does acknowledge that there are important differences between games and traditional narratives, and since the chief of these is the agency games confer on players, Mateas seeks to modify Aristotle &ldquo;to address interactivity&rdquo; (19).&nbsp; He describes not only how Aristotle may specifically be modified within his new media poetics, but also presents an example in <em>Fa&ccedil;ade</em><em>,</em> an interactive drama he and Andrew Stern are developing for one player and two AI agents governed by this digital poetics (19).&nbsp; While I would have liked Mateas to consider what the poetics of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) might look like&mdash;where the ratio between artificial agents and real players is at a minimum&mdash;his attempt to provide an aesthetic system for evaluating and designing narrative-oriented cyberdrama is a valuable contribution to new media studies.</p>
  <p>Not everyone that views narrative as a useful lens for understanding game-like new media goes so far as Murray and the other cyberdramatists.&nbsp; Jenkins, for example, explicitly denies that all games are stories, although he does acknowledge that &ldquo;[m]any games <em>do</em> have narrative aspirations&rdquo; (119).&nbsp; Both he and Eric Zimmerman indicate in their essays&rsquo; introductions that they will try to strike a balance between the ludologists and narratologists by simply considering how the ludic and narrative structures of games may interact.&nbsp; Yet despite this egalitarian intent, the way each understands this relationship ultimately places more emphasis on story than game.</p>
  <p>On the other end of the narrative-game spectrum, the ludologists want to reverse this trend by focusing on the actual experience of the game itself.&nbsp; Aarseth&rsquo;s essay sets a representative tone for these theorists.&nbsp; He works to show how &ldquo;stories and games are different structures that are in effect doing opposite things,&rdquo; and declares that one should examine games apart from other media objects in order to discover what is unique about them (45).&nbsp; That which is &ldquo;the hidden structure&rdquo; behind these key differences&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;is the concept of simulation (52).&nbsp; For Aarseth, simulation is what makes the kinaesthetic pleasure of a game possible as it makes possible the creation of a world in which details are so well integrated that the physics (physical, meta-, and otherwise) of the gameworld respond in meaningful ways to a player&rsquo;s choices.&nbsp; Only through the exploration of the <em>gaming situation itself</em> can one begin to understand how simulation functions.&nbsp; In his response, Stuart Moulthrop accepts Aarseth&rsquo;s militant tone, but questions whether the desire to seal games off hermetically ignores social situations that lead to particular details within the gameworld, such as the &ldquo;pneumatic Lara Croft&rdquo; from <em>Tomb Raider</em> (47).&nbsp; Here, and in his own essay, Moulthrop calls for a ludologically-slanted cultural criticism within game studies, as well as demonstrating the importance of maintaining the visibility media within a post-9/11 global community.&nbsp; Media that is not transparent will, like games, be subject to configuration.&nbsp; And the participation in configurative media experience (for which games serve as an example), as opposed to passive consumption of interpretive experience (narrative), &ldquo;implies at least the possibility of opposition&rdquo; to the &ldquo;[t]he declaration (or acclamation) of war&rdquo; by a 24-7 news feed (67).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Perhaps <em>First Person</em>&rsquo;s best realization of a strict analysis of gameplay itself is Jesper Juul&rsquo;s extraordinary piece, &ldquo;Introduction to Game Time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He asserts that we must begin to see the relation between time spent playing a game in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world (&ldquo;play time&rdquo;) and the movement of time within the gameworld itself (&ldquo;event time&rdquo;).&nbsp; He charts a multitude of ways in which these times can interact, since the structure of games with their cut-scenes, saved games, level jumping, and deaths all allow event time to move more loosely than play time.&nbsp; While only in its infancy, Juul&rsquo;s work makes possible a way in which to think chrono-phenomenologically about gameplay.&nbsp; While even the suggestion may be anathema to ludologists due to its link to literary studies, I wonder how Mikhail Bakhtin&rsquo;s concept of the chronotope could further Juul&rsquo;s work and provide a bridge between game-oriented and narrative-oriented studies.&nbsp; Among the other ludological arguments in the book, Simon Penny&rsquo;s essay works as a nice corollary and potential corrective to Aarseth&rsquo;s, as he contends that every simulation is engineered to teach the user one behavior or another and asks game players and theorists to consider what they are being trained to do.&nbsp; Frasca&rsquo;s &ldquo;Videogames of the Oppressed&rdquo; postulates new forms of game/theatre that could dispense with narrative while still providing the players/audience with immersion and agency.</p>
  <p>However, &ldquo;[g]ame equipment and literature are not the only concerns of <em>First Person</em>,&rdquo; and the last four sections of the book (&ldquo;Hypertexts &amp; Interactives,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pixel/The Line,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beyond Chat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Readings&rdquo;) focus on the editors&rsquo; second objective: to investigate &ldquo;examples of textual/literary practices (including hypertexts) that in their internal procedures or audience interaction can be thought of as performance or gameplay, or that provoke us to reconsider these terms&rdquo; (xi, xii).&nbsp; While this question is related to that which orients the first half of the book&mdash;essentially, it asks how the concepts of &ldquo;game&rdquo; and &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; function within new media objects when an audience/reader is given the chance to interact with the work&mdash;it produces a group of essays that are less coherent in their relation to one another.&nbsp; Many of the pieces are strong, but considering all forms of new media&mdash;not just games&mdash;means that it is often difficult to see how the essayists are in conversation with one another.</p>
  <p>For example, while Murray and Aarseth write directly to (and against) one another, Warren Sack&rsquo;s analysis of &ldquo;Very Large-Scale Conversations&rdquo; (VLSC) considers an object none of the other twenty-four essays do.&nbsp; A VLSC is discourse created and found within large, network-based, and public spaces, such as Usenet groups and email lists.&nbsp; Sack&rsquo;s innovation is the creation of an interface that he calls the Conversation Map, which analyzes thousands of messages and generates a means by which one can navigate the conversation they represent socially (seeing which people are in direct conversation with one another), semantically (as it employs one thesaurus to track significant themes and creates a second that shows how terms are metaphorically linked to one another within the threads), and spatially (two-dimensionally, as in the graphic interface, and as a three-dimensional data set).&nbsp; Using such a tool provides those in a conversation with a level of meta-awareness about the impact and scope of their own participation, thereby shaping the conversation as it happens.&nbsp; Sack is appropriately self-reflective about the need to make his cultural assumptions explicit while creating an interface for the global, networked community, but I wonder whether the concept of a &ldquo;map&rdquo; would not disrupt much of the pleasurable chaos of the Usenet community or to what extent it will lead to a colonization of the territory it seeks to chart.&nbsp; These are questions that one raises reading Sack through Moulthrop&rsquo;s eyes, but seeing what the concept of the VLSC imparts to the study of game-like new media is much more difficult&mdash;and the editors provide little connective tissue to this end.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Sack presents an innovative approach to a common digital experience that may make the discussion about games (by scholars or fans in strategy forums) more comprehensible.</p>
  <p>Although also lacking the explicit connection to one another that characterized the narratologist-ludologist debate, other essays in the second half of the book are similarly admirable: N. Katherine Hayles&rsquo;s reading of Talan Memmott&rsquo;s <em>Lexia to Perplexia</em> (reprinted from her <em>Writing Machines</em> [2002]), John Cayley&rsquo;s insistence that we redefine &ldquo;the digital&rdquo; as something more than a simple 0/1 binary construction, and J. Yellowlees Douglas and Andrew Hargadon&rsquo;s analysis of immersion within the both games and hypertexts.&nbsp; Others seem more out of place, such as Natalie Jeremijenko&rsquo;s cultural studies analysis of the function of Voice Chips within consumer goods and Stephanie Strickland&rsquo;s interpretation of oscillated text and images.&nbsp; Exploring the &ldquo;sociotechnical scripts&rdquo; that speech recognition chips enact is a fascinating concept, and Jeremijenko impresses both by the depth and breadth of her study (262).&nbsp; Yet it feels truncated, as if culled from a larger work, and, like Phoebe Senger&rsquo;s essay on schizophrenia and artificial intelligence in the &ldquo;Critical Simulation&rdquo; chapter, becomes difficult due to its absented context.&nbsp; The book closes with Nick Montfort&rsquo;s attempts to bring analysis of Interactive Fiction into realms beyond the story-game opposition which the genre initiated and, as the editors note, brings the volume full circle to its original themes.</p>
  <p>A review of <em>First Person </em>would be incomplete without briefly considering the book&rsquo;s companion website, which is hosted by the <em>electronic book review</em> (<em>ebr</em>) and is integral to reading the entirety of the text.&nbsp; The &ldquo;experiment in publication&rdquo;&mdash;using both print and online media&mdash;is largely successful, and it makes nothing but the best of sense to have texts about new media become new media objects in and of themselves (xii).&nbsp; Portions of the book are being featured on <em>ebr</em>&rsquo;s homepage throughout Summer 2004, but all of the URLs provided within the printed text are active.&nbsp; Additionally, the site features essays not mentioned in the text, such as Jane McGoingal&rsquo;s response to all three essays in the &ldquo;Cyberdrama&rdquo; chapter and an exchange between Jan Van Looy and Simon Penny about Penny&rsquo;s principal essay.&nbsp; Reading the text goes best if one has simultaneous access to both the website and printed book, as this gives one access to full-text versions of all the essays and responses.</p>
  <p>Yet, the agency of the reader is restricted in some surprising ways for a website connected with a body of work that places such an emphasis on meaningful choice, on first-personhood, so to speak.&nbsp; For instance, when navigating between principal essays and responses online one is required to follow a different path than that the book would suggest and retracing one&rsquo;s steps is difficult.&nbsp; Also, things are never quite where one expects them to be throughout the whole of the site, and this impairs the experiential flow of text/site.&nbsp; However, the most limiting aspect of the site is the way in which it belies the editors&rsquo; assertion that &ldquo;&hellip;the online conversation will continue to grow&mdash;with expanding &lsquo;first person&rsquo; commentary from another level of thoughtful readership: including, perhaps, you&rdquo; (xii).&nbsp; At the time of writing there is no way for readers to post their own responses to <em>First Person</em>.&nbsp; Perhaps sending an essay to the editors of the book or <em>ebr</em> will result in inclusion in the site&rsquo;s threads, but nothing on the site indicates that this is so.&nbsp; Such a system may help maintain the level of scholarly debate that Wardrip-Fruin and Harigan (understandably) desire for their text, but it is a far cry from the VLSC I envisioned when I first read their invitation.</p>
  Yet despite some weaknesses in its second half and an occasionally problematic website, <em>First Person </em>is a fascinating examination of a rapidly expanding field.&nbsp; It gives an overview not only of the scope of what may be considered new media, but provides the beginnings of a critical vocabulary with which to engage works as diverse as Blizzard&rsquo;s <em>World of Warcraft</em>, the aesthetic mathematic Flash-work of Jared Tarbell, and the multiple capabilities of your new cell phone.&nbsp; In this sense, <em>First Person</em> acts as an important primary map in the navigation of the small-(but increasingly large)-scale conversation about new media. </div>

          <p>The work most like Michael Davidson&rsquo;s <em>Guys Like Us: Citing Masculinity in Cold War Poetics</em> is probably Ed Brunner&rsquo;s <em>Cold War Poetry</em>, itself a recent issue (University of Illinois Press, 2001) and perhaps the only other book to bring a broad cultural studies approach to bear on an assessment of the poetry of the 1950s.&nbsp; Brunner&rsquo;s study focuses on the often caricaturized &ldquo;center&rdquo; of American poetry written during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations&mdash;on the &ldquo;mainstream poets who successfully survived in their own time, who achieved broad institutional support, who produced the verse that was being published in the <em>Kenyon Review</em> and the <em>New Republic</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunner&rsquo;s interests range widely from Richard Wilbur&rsquo;s poetics of accommodation and the period&rsquo;s anthology wars to the proliferation of the sestina and poetic responses to the bomb.&nbsp; His excellent chapters on fatherhood and the nuclear family as well as how male reviewers &ldquo;policed&rdquo; poetry written by women suggest the importance of gender to an understanding of poetry produced during this time and, likewise, the importance of a book such as Davidson&rsquo;s, which takes as its chief subject the ways that poetry responded to, and was itself shaped by, cultural notions of masculinity in the first decade of the Cold War.</p>
          <p><em>Guys Like U</em>s, however, turns our attention away from the mainstream and toward &ldquo;non-traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; poets in groups like the Beats, the Black Mountain School, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the Black Arts Movement who &ldquo;[refused] to feed the cultural machine that manufactures consensus&rdquo; (226).&nbsp; For Davidson (author of <em>Ghostlier Demarcations: Modern Poetry and the Material World</em> and editor of <em>The New Collected Poems of George Oppen</em>), these &ldquo;poetic communities&rdquo; are particularly interesting for two main reasons.&nbsp; First, in self-consciously situating themselves outside the mainstream, they had an opportunity to explore models of masculinity and male sexuality outside of the conformist, heterosexual, family man ideal of the time&mdash;an ideal facing challenges in the larger culture as well by way of the Kinsey Reports, Betty Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, movies starring Marlon Brando, James Dean, and John Wayne, and new social categories such as the rock star and motorcycle gang member.&nbsp; At the same time, and secondly, many of these communities adopting &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; positions did so within an ethos of what Davidson, via Adrienne Rich and Eve Sedgwick, calls a &ldquo;compulsory homosociality&rdquo; which frequently replicated paradigms of gender identity from the very mainstream they sought to counter.&nbsp; In the hands of a less perspicacious critic, this two-pronged approach might become tired or formulaic, but Davidson continually complicates his focus by examining gender&rsquo;s conjunction(s) with race, sexuality, and literary heritage.&nbsp; And by weaving a broad cultural history out of film, television, novels, and Cold War policies and anxieties, Davidson&rsquo;s work becomes a welcome, stimulating&mdash;and dare I say entertaining?&mdash;addition to studies of how innovative poetries engage and get engaged by their times. </p>
          <p> Davidson describes and illustrates his notion of compulsory homosociality in Chapter One, &ldquo;Compulsory Homosociality: Charles Olson, Jack Spicer, and the Gender of Poetics.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have linked Rich&rsquo;s and Sedgwick&rsquo;s terms,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;in order to suggest that in certain communities&mdash;literary circles or artistic movements, for instance&mdash;obligatory heterosexuality is reinforced even when those communities contain a large number of homosexual males. . .What remains constant within the largely male forums within which the avant-garde was debated was that the structure of homosocial relations, genitalized or not, often undergirds the production of new art forms and practices, even though that structure is often at odds with the liberatory sexual ethos that articulates those practices&rdquo; (29).&nbsp; These relations don&rsquo;t have to be strictly biographical; they can be realized textually as well, as evidenced by Olson and Spicer.&nbsp; Not only, for example, does Olson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Projective Verse&rdquo; configure his poetics via a semantic masculinity, but while the document preserves and acknowledges its male contributors, it erases the discussions that Olson had with Frances Bolderoff which were equally important to the essay&rsquo;s development.&nbsp; This allegiance to a literary &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s club&rdquo; showed itself in Olson&rsquo;s relations with female students and homosexual colleagues as well, so that while his vision &ldquo;was often progressive in its resistance to commercialism and conformism, it was often limited in its incorporation of others&rdquo; (40).&nbsp; Nor is obligatory homosexuality a strictly heterosexual phenomenon, as even the &ldquo;insular&rdquo; community that formed around Spicer in the San Francisco gay bar scene &ldquo;did not prevent the development of its own forms of exclusion and homophobia&rdquo; (41).&nbsp; Spicer&rsquo;s poetry, translations, and competitive group ethos &ldquo;configured homosexuality within an almost Calvinist sense of moral imperatives,&rdquo; Davidson writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The battle for poetry had to be waged against the twin evils of femininity and assimilation.&rdquo; <a href="guys2.html">&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

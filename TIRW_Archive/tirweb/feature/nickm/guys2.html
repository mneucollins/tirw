  <p><strong>A review of <em>Guys Like Us: Citing Masculinity in Cold War Poetics</em>, page 2 <br>
      <br>
  </strong>If Davidson appears comfortable with the terms &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;margin&rdquo; in Chapter One, Chapter Two, &ldquo;From Margin to Mainstream: Postwar Poetry and the Politics of Containment,&rdquo; complicates them via the lyric poem.&nbsp; Pointing out the existence of at least two different &ldquo;mainstreams&rdquo; in Cold War America&mdash;a literary mainstream most often separate from a mass consumer mainstream&mdash;Davidson examines how Cold War lyrics, &ldquo;seemingly the epitomes of convention&rdquo; could afford writers opportunities to elude or question dominant notions of &ldquo;normalcy.&rdquo;&nbsp; As national anxieties about the threat of communism were oftentimes displaced onto domestic lives and concerns about the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; performance of gender and family roles, Davidson argues that Robert Creeley, Gwendolyn Brooks, John Wieners and Frank O&rsquo;Hara &ldquo;were exploring looser lyric forms in order to test a variety of new social idiolects&rdquo; (54) that were social in origin but personal in expression.&nbsp; In addition to a particularly successful reading of O&rsquo;Hara (&ldquo;the last poet one might associate with cold war subjects&rdquo; (66)), this chapter is especially provocative for how it responds to critical dismissals of the lyric as &ldquo;the genre seemingly furthest from history&rdquo; (74).&nbsp; By situating it as a social form, and by comparing other lyrics by Wilbur, Robert Lowell, and Randall Jarrell, Davidson opens the door to recovering the fifties lyric for a cultural studies and even avant garde reader.</p>
  <p> Chapters Three (&ldquo;<em>The Lady from Shanghai</em>: California Orientalism and &lsquo;Guys Like Us&rsquo;&rdquo;), Four (&ldquo;&lsquo;When the world strips down and rouges up&rsquo;: Redressing Whitman&rdquo;) and Five (&ldquo;The Changing Name: Writing Gender in the Black Arts Nation Script&rdquo;) explore how the compulsory homosocial nature of &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; literary groups is itself shaped by intersecting with other American margins&mdash;the American west coast, literary forebears and their homotextual identities, and African-American and feminist struggles for social justice.&nbsp; Chapter Three looks at how Beat writers Kenneth Rexroth and Jack Kerouac configured the U.S. West Coast as an exotic &ldquo;Eastern&rdquo; or Asian alternative to New York in order to &ldquo;reinforce heterosexual male community against the pressures of East Coast sophistication and privilege&rdquo; (86).&nbsp; While Davidson adeptly orchestrates a range of cultural sources throughout the whole of <em>Guys Like Us</em>, &ldquo;The Lady from Shanghai&rdquo; showcases that ability more than other chapters; in 23 pages, he moves from a history of Chinese immigration to discussions of Orson Welles&rsquo;s <em>The Lady from Shanghai </em>(1947), Jack Spicer, Bret Harte&rsquo;s 1870 ballad &ldquo;Plain Language from Truthful James,&rdquo; Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s first published story, Rexroth&rsquo;s poetry, Kerouac&rsquo;s fiction, and Wayne Wang&rsquo;s films <em>Chan Is Missing</em> (1981) and <em>Eat a Bowl of Tea</em> (1989).&nbsp; If the chapter&rsquo;s historical and generic scope threatens to swallow the poetry of the Cold War whole, it nonetheless rewards us with a rich material landscape that is both producing and being (re)produced by the poetry of the fifties.</p>
  <p>For this reader, Chapter Five was the least innovative and yet most promising section of the book.&nbsp; Exploring how &ldquo;positive images of blackness&rdquo; (138) in the Black Arts Movement &ldquo;[were] often founded on gender hierarchies that limit its political impact&rdquo; (131), Davidson looks at the construction of black masculinity in the work of Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones) and Haki Madhubuti (Don L. Lee) and then at how women poets Audre Lorde, Sonia Sanchez and Ntozake Shange critiqued that masculinity&rsquo;s limitations of black womanhood.&nbsp; As Davidson himself notes, &ldquo;Black Power rhetoric was famously homophobic and misogynist&rdquo; (128), and the critique of this rhetoric by black womanist thinkers and writers is probably even more famous, influencing as it did the course of black civil rights and feminism.&nbsp; While &ldquo;The Changing Name&rdquo; is a good overview of this history, that overview has less of a new spin on the material than other chapters have.&nbsp; But if this is so, of all the chapters in the book, this one is most true to Davidson&rsquo;s desire to focus on the dynamics of poetic<em> communities</em> in Cold War America.&nbsp; As opposed to the &ldquo;more familiar school-based criticism&rdquo; which &ldquo;presumes group agreement on certain aesthetic tenets,&rdquo; Davidson wants to value how &ldquo;communities,&rdquo; in contrast, foreground &ldquo;the fruitful role of dissension, disagreement, panic, and erotic play that underlie group formation&rdquo; (18).&nbsp; Up until Chapter Five, however, the role of this dissension has been pretty distant, and when it does occur&mdash;as it does in Wayne Wang&rsquo;s films at the end of Chapter Three&mdash;that critique happens in another genre or twenty to thirty years later.&nbsp; One wonders whether there are texts from within the Black Mountain, Beat or San Francisco milieus that offer critiques of Olson&rsquo;s text, Spicer&rsquo;s group, or Rexroth&rsquo;s poetry in the way that Lorde, Sanchez and Shange&rsquo;s do for the Black Arts Movement.&nbsp; Exploring such moments seems essential to establishing the value of &ldquo;poetic communities&rdquo; in Davidson&rsquo;s approach, and Chapter Five offers a model for what that work might look like.</p>
  <p>In contrast to Chapter Five, Chapter Six (&ldquo;Definitive Haircuts: Female Masculinity in Elizabeth Bishop and Sylvia Plath&rdquo;) is a thrilling addition to the book, an excellent balance of Davidson&rsquo;s forays into history, film, and poetry that explores &ldquo;what happens when masculinity is detached from a biological male and attached to a female body&rdquo; (159).&nbsp; In doing so, Davidson sets Bishop and Plath within Cold War discussions of &ldquo;butch&rdquo; sexuality and films like <em>Mildred Pierce</em> (1945) that respond to the ambiguous sexuality of the &ldquo;masculinized female&rdquo; subject position.&nbsp; For him, Bishop and Plath are interesting for how they &ldquo;locate their ambiguous gender positions <em>between</em> rather than <em>at</em> one or another pole of a dyadic gender structure&rdquo; while moving comfortably within a fairly conservative official verse culture (169, Davidson&rsquo;s italics).&nbsp; In poems such as &ldquo;Arrival at Santos,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Riverman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crusoe in England,&rdquo; Bishop&rsquo;s blurring of gender boundaries becomes the means by which she manages relationships with other women during a period hostile to those relations.&nbsp; If Bishop is thus &ldquo;refracting&rdquo; her lesbianism to circumvent the dangers of autobiography, then Plath oftentimes &ldquo;puts on the clothing of patriarchy to test its cultural power&rdquo; (182).&nbsp; For Davidson, &ldquo;The ghost in the closet is not Plath&rsquo;s animus toward men. . .but that she could identify so richly with masculine subject-positions&rdquo; (193).</p>
  <p> Davidson begins <em>Guys Like Us</em> by remembering the 1950s television character of Percy Dovetonsils, a &ldquo;poet&rdquo; played by Ernie Kovac whose outrageous homosexual stereotype &ldquo;was a queer alternative to the masculine ideals of the day as embodied by John Wayne, James Dean, and Marlon Brando&rdquo; (2).&nbsp; While that example effectively introduces Davidson&rsquo;s subject, it also stands as the only time, other than Harte&rsquo;s nineteenth century ballad in Chapter Three, that Davidson turns to popular poetry for material.&nbsp; Understandably, he and Brunner focus on &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; and &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; poetry of the decade, but neither stop to consider how the popular poetry of the fifties might assist a discussion of that time.&nbsp; As far away from &ldquo;official verse culture&rdquo; as the Beats or the Black Arts Movement were, another (popular) narrative would complicate the margin/mainstream binary that shapes critical discussions and might shed more light on how poetry affected gender performance on a wider scale.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking, initially, of the thousands of extremely popular Burma-Shave advertisements that lined American highways with six-billboard poems well into the 1960s&mdash;poems that constantly addressed the tonsorial condition of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; American male as he and his nuclear family took their Sunday drives through the country.&nbsp; If, as Davidson points out, Allen Ginsberg lamented the presence of the sweet-smelling female in &ldquo;society&rsquo;s perfum&rsquo;d marriage,&rdquo; what might he have made of Burma-Shave&rsquo;s regular appeals to the ideal of smooth, soft, and scented <em>male</em> skin?&nbsp; Shaving with the company&rsquo;s product (or so the company claimed) would attract members of the opposite sex, but the playful rhymes and narratives of the billboards&mdash;such as the following two written in 1950 and 1955 respectively&mdash;could also suggest alternate models of masculine sexuality from within the consumer culture of normalcy itself:</p>

  <p>Davidson, of course, can only take on so much material at once, however.&nbsp; Perhaps the greatest sign of the contribution that <em>Guys Like Us</em> makes to studies of American poetry are the directions for rich and further study which it suggests. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

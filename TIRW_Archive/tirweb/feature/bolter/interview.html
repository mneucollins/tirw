          AN INTERVIEW WITH JAY DAVID BOLTER<br>
          by David Silver </b></div>
        <p>For more than twenty years, Jay David Bolter has written about new 
          media. Currently Wesley Professor of New Media and Director of the Center 
          for New Media Research and Education in the School of Literature, Communication 
          and Culture at Georgia Tech, Bolter's first book, <i>Turing's Man: Western 
          Culture in the Computer Age</i>, was published in 1984. <i>Writing Space: 
          The Computer, Hypertext, and the History of Writing</i>, his highly 
          influential book which informs much of the field of &quot;hypertext 
          theory,&quot; followed in 1991. In 1999, Richard Grusin and he published 
          <i>Remediation: Understanding New Media</i>, the topic of this brief 
          interview. His most recent book, co-authored with Diane Gromala, <i>Windows 
          and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital Art, and the Myth of Transparency</i>, 
          was published in 2003.</p>
        <p>In addition to writing about new media, Bolter has been active in designing 
          it. Collaborating with Michael Joyce, Bolter is the author of Storyspace, 
          an early and influential program for creating hypertexts. And together 
          with Blair Macintyre, he is building an Augmented Reality system that 
          creates, in his words, &quot;ghost movies.&quot;</p>
        <p>This interview took place between July and August, 2003, and was conducted 
          via email.</p>
        <p><b>David Silver: </b>With <i>Remediation,</i> published in 1999, you 
          and Richard Grusin introduced the extremely useful concept of remediation. 
          It was immediately discussed, questioned, and employed by many scholars 
          working in various fields of inquiry. It's four years later, and I'm 
          wondering how you think the definition holds up. Are there parts that 
          you believe should be tweaked, modified? </p>
        <p><b>Jay David Bolter: </b>I would not change our definition of remediation. 
          Everyday I find examples of the ways in which digital media forms borrow 
          from and attempt to appropriate the status of older forms. However, 
          I would change the way the concept was presented. In our book we were 
          trying to reach two different audiences: the humanities community, whose 
          interest in media theory grows out of contemporary cultural theory, 
          and a larger community of new media designers and enthusiasts. For the 
          cultural theorists, the book may have seemed to be an apology for digital 
          technology--that is, not critical enough of the global media industry. 
          For them, new digital media (computer games, the WWW) are simply extensions 
          of traditional mass media and can be understood as part of global or 
          late capitalism. For the larger community involved in making new media 
          forms, the idea of remediation probably seems too conservative. That 
          larger community is still very much under the spell of the modernist 
          notion that new media must be revolutionary in order to be important. 
          For them, new media must break with the traditions of older media, and 
          of course remediation argues that such a break is not possible. I do 
          not think that we could have made either group happy. But it would probably 
          have been better to produce two different books, each of which was aimed 
          specifically at the concerns and interests of one of the groups.</p>
        <p><b>DS:</b> Well, two books would have been nice, but I'm afraid that 
          many of us are still trying to digest the contents of the first book.</p>
        <p>In your response, you mentioned a number of everyday examples of remediation. 
          Indeed, in the last two years, there's been a flood of arenas from which 
          to witness remediation: the 2000 election; the 2000 selection; media 
          coverage of 9-11, the Taliban, and the War on Afghanistan; and of course 
          the War on Iraq (along with its end, which hasn't seemed to happen yet).</p>
        <p>Considering that the War on Iraq was doubly-mediated--both as it was 
          fought and as it was reported-- can you talk about the concept of remediation 
          in terms of the current war-entertainment network in the United States?</p>
        <p><b>JDB:</b> Richard Grusin and I have suggested that there are two 
          strategies of remediation: transparency and hypermediacy. The American 
          military-entertainment complex subscribes fully to the strategy of transparency. 
          Even while the American television networks revel in their technology, 
          they insist that they are giving us the events without mediation-- events 
          &quot;as they happen.&quot; Many media critics of course argued that 
          the Persian Gulf War was constructed as a media event, indeed often 
          as a video game, in which the destruction on the ground became difficult 
          to distinguish from its mediated presentation. In the Gulf War Part 
          II, the government, military, and news media have gotten even closer 
          to the goal of a perfectly seamless presentation. In this war, the networks 
          kept emphasizing how much more sophisticated the weapons have become, 
          making it possible to overthrow the regime while limiting civilian casualties. 
          Just as important, however, was how much more sophisticated their media 
          coverage had become, making it possible to efface most of the evidence 
          of civilian and even enemy casualities, while at the same time purporting 
          to give transparent coverage. Even the architects of the war seem to 
          believe in the myth of transparency that they have created. By &quot;embedding&quot; 
          journalists with the units, they were able to achieve apparently total 
          immediacy while actually staging the presentation to a remarkable degree. 
          Everyone, including the American public, joined in the collective effort 
          to ensure transparency. That's why now there is now (to the weary astonishment 
          of the rest of the world) genuine surprise and consternation about not 
          finding the weapons of mass destruction that the government's own transparent 
          spy technology assured them and us were &quot;really&quot; there.</p>
        <p><b>DS:</b> Absolutely. I see and agree with all of your points. Currently 
          living in Amsterdam, I've witnessed first-hand how transparency was/is 
          both unsupported and shattered, and the Dutch I've spoken to are all 
          the more educated and critical for it.</p>
        <p>While I understand your points regarding digital simulation in the 
          representation of war, I am curious about three other angles: digital 
          simulation used in the recruitment, training, and fighting the war. 
          The US military has and continues to use all kinds of advanced digital 
          technologies for recruitment tools; war training, as described wonderfully 
          in James Der Derian's Virtuous War: Mapping the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment 
          Network, is becoming more and more simulated; and Rumsfeld's wet dream 
          of fully digitized soldier/squadron/artillery/network is here and increasing. 
          In other words, digital technologies are part of the representation 
          and product of contemporary war. How would you link these phenomena 
          to remediation?</p>
        <p><b>JDB:</b> I am not sure how to respond to this question. It seems 
          facile and callous to suggest that war has always been mediated and 
          that these new technologies are simply refashioning earlier media forms. 
          Perhaps the attempt to mediate war could be said to start with the Iliad. 
          Ancient wars were mediated through oral and then written poetry. Modern 
          warfare (from the 19th century) were, obviously, mediated by the mass 
          communication technologies of industrial printing, photography, poster 
          art, film, and television. In the 20th century, this trend (the mediation 
          of war) was aestheticized and glorified by the Futurists and of course 
          the Nazis among others. In all those cases, the goal was greater immediacy 
          through verbal and then visual fidelity. The current American version 
          (the Military-Entertainment complex) is a remediation in the sense that 
          it attempts to exploit the characteristics of digital technology for 
          &quot;simulation&quot; and &quot;interactivity.&quot; These characteristics 
          are both transparent and reflective at the same time. They bring the 
          user closer to the action, while at the same time providing a supposedly 
          safe distance. Isn't that what the US military is now (tacitly) conditioning 
          the American people to expect? Wars in which American power can be perfectly 
          projected anywhere on the planet, but in which there will be no causalities 
          (at least no American causalities)?</p>
        <p><b>DS:</b> Ok, let's change tracks as we bring our discussion to an 
          end. How can the anti-war movement-- academics, activists, artists-- 
          integrate elements of remediation into their strategies?</p>
        <p><b>JDB:</b> I'm afraid I don't have a satisfying answer for this question.</p>
        <p>Remediation is an academic theory about how media and media forms interact 
          in our culture. I have always been concerned that theory should have 
          practical consequences-- in this case, that remediation as a theory 
          should help to inform practice. However, for me, that meant the practice 
          of designing new media artifacts, not political activism. Of course, 
          there is a general sense in which &quot;media literacy&quot; can help 
          to make viewing public less ready to accept the ideologies that are 
          conveyed to them. I suppose that my (small) contribution to the goal 
          of media literacy would be the critique of immediacy. Analog visual 
          media (film and photography) and now electronic visual media (television 
          and the WWW) attempt to co-opt their viewers to dominant ideologies 
          by pretending to be transparent-- by presenting the real as if it were 
          unmediated. Viewers and users should be aware of this myth of immediacy 
          and should resist it. But remediation as a theory is not likely to have 
          much impact outside of the field of media studies. My sense is that 
          real activism needs to rely on traditional methods (politics, civil 
          disobedience), and not on academic theory. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, isn't our current national and international predicament 
          the utter negation of postmodern critical theory? All of these critical 
          tools seem to have failed to account for the &quot;new&quot; American 
          imperialism. For there is nothing postmodern about this imperialistic 
          impulse. It relies on a religious zeal analogous to that of British 
          imperialism in the 19th century. And it seems to be nationalistic in 
          its economic vision. Where are the supranational corporations that were 
          supposed to be in control in the era of late capitalism? Meanwhile, 
          both new and traditional media seem to be reduced to presenting (remediating) 
          the situation &quot;on the ground,&quot; which as in the past is dictated 
          by guns and bombs, albeit smart ones.<br>

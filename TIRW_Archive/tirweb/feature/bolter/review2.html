        <p>Their discussion of transparency and reflection is expanded in the 
          chapters that follow. In the second chapter they describe another of 
          the works from SIGGRAPH, <i>Wooden Mirror</i> by Daniel Rozin. In this 
          piece, what the viewer initially encounters is a large, framed panel 
          made up of wooden tiles. When the viewer moves in front of the &quot;mirror,&quot; 
          a hidden camera captures his/her image and relays that to a computer 
          that signals controllers behind each tile. The tiles adjust their position, 
          using light and cast shadow to create a reflection of the captured video 
          image. Bolter and Gromala discuss <i>Wooden Mirror</i> in terms of this 
          balance between transparency and reflectivity. &quot;It is a strangely 
          truthful kind of mirror that doesn't deliver on its promise of transparency, 
          in part because the wooden tiles have a pleasing texture that makes 
          us aware of the surface&quot; (34). The experience occasioned by this 
          mirror is both &quot;looking at and looking through,&quot; reflective 
          and transparent (34). Bolter and Gromala then move away from <i>Wooden 
          Mirror</i> and into a discussion of interface design. They point to 
          the tendency to talk of the disappearance of the interface as the proper 
          aim of design. They give a history of the Macintosh interface in order 
          to demonstrate that pure transparency has always been a myth, that interfaces 
          function most successfully when they oscillate between being transparent 
          windows on information or experience and being opaque/reflective surfaces 
          that users can identify and manipulate. &quot;The danger of transparency 
          is that the interface will mask the operation of the system exactly 
          when the user needs to see and understand what the system is doing&quot; 
          (55).</p>
        <p>Bolter and Gromala more or less follow this structure for the rest 
          of the book, deviating only in the conclusion and colophon: They describe 
          a specific work from SIGGRAPH, including the design of the Art Gallery 
          itself, and use that as a jumping off point for analysis of specific 
          points about digital design. In particular, they continue to reinforce 
          the ways that successful digital artifacts are both transparent and 
          reflective, both window and mirror. This metaphor, however, starts to 
          seem a bit overplayed given the lack of direct theoretical engagement 
          and explication in this book. In their acknowledgements, the authors 
          state that while familiar with the theories of Dawkins, Deleuze and 
          Guattari. Haraway, Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Lacan, and Baudrillard, 
          they </p>
        <blockquote> &quot;choose not to discuss them, because this is a book 
          about the craft of and the material engagement with digital art and 
          design, and we believe that the theoretical literature often strays 
          too far from practice to be useful for our purposes&quot; (x-xi).</blockquote>
        <p>Bolter and Gromala's choice here is unfortunate. Without more detailed 
          attention to the particulars of a theoretical framework that this book 
          might articulate, their emphasis on &quot;windows and mirrors&quot; 
          falls flat by the end of the text. Ironically, the <i>lack</i> of theory 
          in this book creates a distancing from practice similar to the one they 
          criticize as residing <i>in</i> theory. The implied binary between theory 
          and practice is not helpful, and seems both critically and practically 
          questionable. Deciding that designers are to be the</p>

        <p>specific audience of this book in no way alleviates the need for critical 
          and eoretical depth. Bolter and Gromala's project could only have been 
          made more valuable by adding a level of theoretical rigor, the onus 
          being upon them to do so without &quot;[straying] too far from practice 
          to be useful&quot; (x-xi).<br>
          In the six-page colophon at the end of the book, Bolter and Gromala 
          turn their attention to the design of their own book, a topic that would 
          have been better placed toward the beginning of the text. Here they 
          discuss of Excretia, a dynamic, digital typeface designed by Gromala. 
          Excretia is a biomorphic font, its actual visible manifestation depending 
          upon the physical state of the typist who is connected to it by biofeedback 
          devices that measure galvanic skin responses, respiration, and heart 
          rate.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;As she writes, these continuous streams of data affect the 
            visual character of the typeface. The words 'throb' as her heart beats; 
            they grow tendrils and spikes if she becomes 'excitable.' As the writer 
            works, the text she has already written may continue to change, or 
            she may choose to freeze it to reflect her state at the very instant 
            of the writing-- in effect, to create a biological-typographical record&quot; 
            (166).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are several images of various manifestations of Excretia, a typeface 
          that is about experience, both in the writing and in the reading. The 
          authors suggest that Excretia be understood as an example of an interface 
          operating as both window and mirror. The authors further note that Excretia 
          was used on the splash pages at the beginning of each chapter. What 
          readers notice, however, is a significant gulf between Bolter and Gromala's 
          description and visual depiction of Excretia in the colophon, and the 
          text that she they find at the beginning of each chapter. The splash 
          pages are not dynamic, reflective surfaces. The text on these pages 
          appears in forms that are familiar and static. A more successful use 
          of Excretia would have exploited the dynamic fluctuations of the font, 
          even if frozen as the snapshot of a particular moment in the writing. 
          If Bolter and Gromala really wanted to push the text as a reflective 
          experience rather than just as a transparent conveyor of information, 
          the splash pages could have become images of Excretia in action. Though 
          perhaps illegible at times, this would have been a much more compelling 
          engagement with the printed text as interface. </p>
        <p>Throughout <i>Windows and Mirrors</i>, the histories of particular 
          technologies are accessible and prove valuable framing devices for particular 
          discussions. The selection of artworks and their descriptions are illuminating. 
          Likewise, their focus on embodied participation with digital artifacts 
          is both striking and necessary in discourses about digital technologies.

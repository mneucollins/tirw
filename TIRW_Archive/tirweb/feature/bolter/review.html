          <p align="left"><i>Windows and Mirrors</i>, the recent book by Jay David 
            Bolter and Diane Gromala, looks specifically at human-computer interaction 
            and interface. This project is framed by a discussion of artworks 
            in the SIGGRAPH 2000 Art Gallery. SIGGRAPH is an annual event, unique 
            in its status as both an academic conference and technological trade 
            show, highlighting the newest technologies and software releases. 
            Digital art has been a component of SIGGRAPH since the early 1980s, 
            but the 2000 conference had the strongest art focus to date.</p>
          <p align="left">Bolter, well-known as a theorist and historian of digital 
            technology, is the co-author of <i>Remediation: Understanding New 
            Media</i> (2000). Gromala, while also a scholar, approaches digital 
            technology from the perspective of a practitioner and a curator. As 
            a practitioner, her current work focuses on biomorphic book arts and 
            typefaces, which I'll discuss in more detail later. As a curator, 
            particularly relevant to the book at hand, she designed the Art Gallery 
            for SIGGRAPH 2000. In spite of their extensive and varied backgrounds 
            in digital technology and scholarship, Bolter and Gromala define the 
            audience for this text somewhat narrowly: <br>
            &quot;This is a book specifically about digital art, but it is written 
            for digital designers and technologists in general: Web designers, 
            educational technologists, graphic designers working with and in digital 
            forms, interface designers, human-computer interaction (HCI) experts, 
            those who are laying out the future of digital media for business 
            and entertainment, and anyone interested in the cultural implications 
            of the digital revolution&quot; (2).</p>
          <p align="left">The particular intervention they perform is arguing 
            that the proper function of &quot;digital artifacts&quot; is to be 
            both a transparent vehicle [&quot;window&quot;] onto information or 
            experience and a reflective experience [&quot;mirror&quot;] -- that 
            is, a potential moment of critical awareness and engagement with the 
            technology itself. Thus they argue that digital art has something 
            to teach more structurally oriented digital designers. Each chapter 
            is laid out as a lesson to this end. </p>

          <p align="left">In the first chapter, for example, Bolter and Gromala 
            begin with a discussion of <i>TEXT RAIN</i>, a piece by Camille Utterback 
            and Romy Archituv. <i>TEXT RAIN</i>, as it appeared at SIGGRAPH, took 
            the form of two large screens, placed parallel to one another in order 
            to form a corridor through the center of the Art Gallery. One screen 
            served as a surface for projected video; the other, a backdrop. Colored 
            letters &quot;rained&quot; from the top of the projection screen. 
            Visitors walking through the corridor were then captured on video 
            and projected onto this screen as well. They found that their bodies 
            interrupted the fall of letters, allowing them to construct a dynamically 
            abstract poem through their movement. Bolter and Gromala's discussion 
            of this work focuses specifically on the role played by audience participation: 
          </p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> &quot;<i>TEXT RAIN</i> is not simply an expression of the 
          artist's personality. (That romantic notion doesn't fit digital art 
          well.) Rather, the experience of this piece comes from the interaction 
          of the viewers with the creators' design. <i>TEXT RAIN</i> is as much 
          an expression of its viewers as of its creators; it is what the viewers 
          make of it. Without them, the piece is incomplete, for there is nothing 
          on the screen but the falling letters&quot; (13).</blockquote>
        <p align="left">The authors then move from the specific focus on <i>TEXT 
          RAIN</i> to a broader history of the computer as a medium. They use 
          this discussion in order to consider the computer's relation to art 
          and to its larger social context as a movement from functioning primarily 
          as a tool or appliance to functioning fully as a medium. This sets the 
          stage for their discussion of human interaction with computers. &quot;Today, 
          we do not operate computers; rather, we interact with them, and successful 
          digital artifacts are designed to be experienced, not simply used&quot; 
          (22). Bolter and Gromala argue that digital art is integral to the experimentation 
          that pushes digital design and human-computer interaction into new realms 
          of experience. The authors take issue with the notion that good digital 
          design should be transparent. Rather, they argue that digital technologies, 
          when they function best, function as a relation between transparency 
          and reflection. <a href="review2.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

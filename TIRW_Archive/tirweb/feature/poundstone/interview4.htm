          <p><b>The Interview, continued</b></p>
          <p><b>BS</b>: New Digital Emblems seems, to me, to have a fairly &quot;transparent&quot; 
            interface, i.e. one that doesn't really try to escape the use of &quot;icon&quot; 
            as we are familiar with it on the desktop, and yet it seems innovative 
            to me in that you are suggesting that this interface has roots that 
            go back to the pre-Rennaissance heroic emblem -- you write that the 
            Emblems &quot;parody&quot; the web interface in this way. What's your 
            sense of the development of the idea of the &quot;interface&quot;? 
            Do you think there is room for innovation here -- as in what the Rhizome 
            folks pursue with their spirals and galaxies and other Java applets 
            -- or is it not important to you? Do you have any desire to create 
            more interactive pieces, or will your focus remain on visual pieces 
            like the jpgs you sent me and the shorts on ubu? Any interfaces out 
            there that strike you as having promise?</p>
          <p><b>WP: </b>I like Rhizome's experimental &quot;interfaces,&quot; 
            especially <a href="http://rhizome.org/object.rhiz?1676" target="_blank">Starry 
            Night</a>. For a while the big deal with artistic sites was to re-present 
            the content of other sites, and then that kind of got old. I think 
            the reason is that if you just want to see &quot;random&quot; places 
            on the Web, Netscape and Microsoft's linear browsers already make 
            it easy to do that. As I see it, the Rhizome interfaces take almost 
            the opposite approach. They really are intended to help you find stuff 
            you want to find (whereas most web &quot;art&quot; tries to get you 
            lost, one way or another!) The information density of Starry Night 
            is high, as is true of a good map or chart. X, Y, and brightness are 
            all significant, and you can read the text without losing the big 
            picture. The downside is that the interface still isn't adequate to 
            the complexity of what's being mapped. I think it's at the level where 
            almost everyone who sees it is impressed but no one actually uses 
            it the way it's intended, as a way of reading Rhizome texts. It will 
            probably take something like a 3-D interface and really high resolution 
            to make the idea practical. </p>
          <p>I don't really consider New Digital Emblems to be &quot;interactive.&quot; 
            I mean, I know that some people will say that it is because you can 
            click on things and make something happen. But that is only the baseline 
            &quot;interactivity&quot; of a table of contents. All the content 
            is already there; you just decide how much of it you want to look 
            at and in what order. I conceived the site's &quot;transparent&quot; 
            interface in opposition to the more usual (opaque?) type, where links 
            or buttons or hot spots are hidden and the user must do a random walk 
            in search of content. The opacity of these interfaces tends to enhance 
            the illusion of interactivity -- or at any rate, the sense that something 
            really cool is going on. It is this pose of mystification that I think 
            is parallel to historic emblems. </p>
          <p>While New Digital Emblems is not itself interactive, it does take 
            interactivity as a subject matter. It seems to me that the only meaningful 
            interactivity is that where the user's actions produce original content. 
            By &quot;original content&quot; I mean something that the site designer 
            could not have fully anticipated. And of course the content has to 
            be interesting. So you need an art- or literature-generating algorithm, 
            and that is a tall order. You can nonetheless get legitimate interactivity 
            using the networked game concept. An example is Masaki Fujihata's 
            Light on the Net [link to be provided], where users manipulate a bank 
            of light bulbs in a Tokyo office building. While the basic idea of 
            remote-controlling something over the Web has now been done to death, 
            and at varying levels of quality, I would cite Light on the Net as 
            a real watershed.</p>
          <p>While I don't think that anything I've done so far qualifies as interactive, 
            I am toying with several ideas for such. Some of the Oulipian concepts 
            are easily programmable and could be enhanced in a networked context. 
            One is the &quot;Morpholo,&quot; a type of modular artwork conceived 
            by Theiri Foulc c. 1983. Despite the name, it doesn't have anything 
            to do with what we'd now call a &quot;morph.&quot; It is more like 
            the concept of a &quot;travesty&quot; applied to the visual realm, 
            a way of generating all-over pictures that are poised between visual 
            sense and nonsense. There are many degrees of freedom in a Morpholo 
            picture. I think it would be worthwhile to do a collaborative version 
            where users change the site's picture at will. With this genre of 
            work, the trick is to find a way that every person can leave a real 
            trace without obliterating everyone else's trace. On some roller-coasters, 
            there's a point where everyone sticks their wad of chewing gum on 
            this growing mountain of chewing gum -- it becomes a collaborative 
            sculpture, appalling and yet fascinating, and often truly &quot;sculptural.&quot; 
            That has always struck me as a useful paradigm for collaborative web 
            pieces. The shape of that chewing mountain is emergent -- no one plans 
            it. I'm hoping that a Morpholo web piece might have a similar emergent 
            quality.</p>
          <p>I'd say the most exciting thing in interfaces are the &quot;ubiquitous&quot; 
            digital works for PDAs that are starting to come out. Being able to 
            beam a digital work to someone creates an entirely different social 
            context for digital art. As with any art form, changing the social 
            context changes practically everything. The &quot;digital divide&quot; 
            is real: There are a lot of people in our society who are not on the 
            Web for economic reasons. So right now, digital art is like Victorian 
            photography, where you had to be landed gentry to afford a camera. 
            At some point, someone is going to invent the digital spray can, a 
            way of transmitting digital art so cheap and portable that every inner-city 
            kid will have one. It will be interesting to see what they do with 
            it, and how it affects the whole spectrum of &quot;high&quot; and 
            &quot;low&quot; digital art. We're not there with this generation 
            of PDAs, but it's moving in that direction. </p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> I'm interested in a distinction you made earlier, between 
            language usage by west coast and east coast artists. There does appear 
            to be a difference in temperament between the way writers on each 
            coast write poetry, but here you are extending this to visual artists 
            choice of language. Would you care to elaborate on that distinction? 
            Also, many of the writers you mention in the Emblems are from the 
            margins of literary activity, and many of the artists are either &quot;outsider&quot; 
            artists or borderline &quot;outsider&quot;? Do you think the web has 
            made a shift in our understanding of the cultural center and margins? 
            In our understandings of how art operates within, and as an expression 
            of, the local?</p>
          <p><b>WP: </b>I'm not sure I've ever tried to articulate that west coast/east 
            coast difference -- nor am I sure that it has much to do with the 
            differences in poetry between the coasts. But let me see if I can 
            say something halfway sensible about it.</p>
          <p>The gimmick with any text-based art (including most concrete poetry) 
            is semantic paradox. The semantic content of the text is in conflict 
            with the way the text looks or the way it is presented to the viewer 
            in a picture or poem. This isn't a pipe, but it is, but it really 
            isn't.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that what's different about the use of text by (many) 
            Los Angeles artists is an additional distancing of the artist from 
            the implied &quot;speaker&quot; of the text. Baldessari's sign paintings 
            from the 1960s are all basically trying to &quot;talk&quot; the viewer 
            into accepting them as great paintings. I don't think that's Baldessari 
            talking to us; it's a deadpan invented persona that evokes, maybe, 
            this bullheaded American attitude that you can talk your way into 
            or out of anything. Or you have the early Nauman neon pieces that 
            voice uncool messages like THE TRUE ARTIST HELPS THE WORLD BY REVEALING 
            MYSTIC TRUTHS -- I can imagine Margaret Keane saying that, maybe. 
            So a lot of L.A. text art has this crypto-literary &quot;game&quot; 
            underlying it, of inventing these unseen personae. It's been a fruitful 
            idea; people are still playing with it today.</p>
          <p>Another element you find in L.A. art is the &quot;big, dumb word.&quot; 
            This is mainly Ruscha's discovery, I guess, that if you take a meaningless 
            word and make it monumental, it becomes interesting. It creates jamais 
            vu -- the opposite of d&egrave;&copy;j&egrave;&Uuml; [fix this in 
            the html to read properly, with accents] vu -- where you look at something 
            familiar and realize it's strange.</p>
          <p>The emblem site invokes a lot of &quot;outsiders&quot; because they're 
            a major interest of mine, both the visual art kind (who are getting 
            a lot of attention) and outsider writers (who generally aren't.) I 
            wouldn't relate that specifically to the Web. The Web is better at 
            erasing geography than the outsider/insider type of dichotomy. (Incidentally: 
            Where are the &quot;outsider&quot; web artists? I have to think that 
            if Henry Darger was alive and under 35, the Vivian Girls and the weather 
            diary would have been conceived for the Web. Of all the self-indulgent 
            web journals choking servers, I've yet to see anything remotely comparable. 
            It's all &quot;vernacular,&quot; nothing &quot;outsider.&quot;)</p>
          <p><b>BS: </b>With your interest in Oulipian writing techniques--many 
            of which require the most severe form of writerly ambition to execute--have 
            you written any works that you'd like to see published in, say, a 
            magazine or book?</p>
          <p><b>WP:</b> I haven't used Oulipian techniques to write novels that 
            don't use the letter e, if that's what you mean. I guess that strikes 
            me as pertaining to a different period of literary history (a period 
            for which I've great affection.) What I take away from the Oulipo 
            is the idea of literature as conceptual art and the idea that algorithms 
            can be a tool for exploring the limits of literature or art. While 
            I wouldn't set down to do the exact sort of thing that Perec or Queneau 
            did, I think a lot about their examples in doing what I do.</p>
          <p><b>BS:</b> As a writer who has been nominated for the Pulitzer, it 
            must have crossed your mind that the New Digital Emblems, which is 
            among other things a great piece of scholarship and synthetic critical 
            thinking, would not be recognized soon in literary culture, both commercial 
            and academic, or even in art culture, where I'm sure writing that 
            links Darger's Vivian Girls, Thomas Cole's The Titan's Goblet and 
            a 16th century emblem by Alciato (to take one example) would be considered 
            innovative, even provocative. What sort of feedback or reaction have 
            you gotten about the site? Are you getting a lot of hits, and is it 
            being accepted--by writers, by net artists--as a work of &quot;art&quot; 
            even if much of it is an essay? Does it concern you that you could 
            never sell the Emblems, and does their immateriality affect their 
            role in culture? Lastly, how do you think this material would have 
            worked as a book? </p>
          <p><b>WP:</b> I wish I had a general solution to the marketability problem. 
            Economically, digital art is about where video art was thirty years 
            ago. This time around, there aren't nearly so many people willing 
            to take the stance that selling through the gallery system doesn't 
            matter. </p>
          <p>In my own case, I sell non-web artworks through the gallery system, 
            so it's possible to rationalize the web pieces as a &quot;loss leader&quot; 
            that might publicize my work generally. As to &quot;limited edition&quot; 
            off-the-Web pieces, I think the most interesting ones are moving in 
            the direction of installations, as video did. Dedicated hardware is 
            an encouragement to rethink the interface and move it beyond staring 
            at a small screen and rolling a mouse. But this gets into significant 
            engineering and cost issues. The artist, who writes the code, also 
            has to be a hardware hacker. Who says the Renaissance person is dead?</p>
          <p>I'm pleased that the Guggenheim has recently bought two web pieces 
            by John Simon Jr. and Mark Napier--not so much because one or two 
            museums are buying web art but because there are a hundred private 
            collectors who will do whatever one or two museums do. It's difficult 
            to say what the interest level will be in ten years. Right now, web 
            art is the flavor of the month. It's not even entirely clear to me 
            that web art is destined to be in museum collections in a big way. 
            For historic reasons, the Museum of Modern Art collects cinema, but 
            practically no other art museum does. </p>
          <p>I've gotten feedback on the emblems site mainly from the web art 
            community (I don't recall anyone particularly raising the &quot;essay&quot; 
            vs. &quot;art&quot; issue) but also from emblem specialists and people 
            with a particular interest in the Oulipo or artists I mention. I got 
            a letter (not e-mail) from Marcel Benabou of the Oulipo, which was 
            unexpected and quite nice. In the past year, the site's gotten about 
            10,000 clients (distinct users who viewed at least one page), and 
            the content has also been reposted on Beehive. I don't know enough 
            about these things to qualify that as &quot;a lot of hits&quot; or 
            not. It is at any rate in the ballpark of a print publication's audience. 
            One thing that's interesting is that the hits have steadily risen 
            since site has been up. Somehow people are finding what must be a 
            rather search-engine-unfriendly site.</p>
          <p>Since I also do &quot;regular&quot; books, I wasn't trying to force 
            New Digital Emblems into that mold. I don't see it as easily translatable 
            to book or article form. The formal conceit was to re-invent the 17th-century 
            emblem book. I don't think that today's emblem book would be a book 
            at all. The emblem book was a proto-cyberpunk reaction to Guttenberg. 
            It was &quot;multi-media&quot; (having woodcut or engraved pictures 
            with text was still a big deal) and ubiquitous (it was in that first 
            flood of books cheap enough for everyone to afford.) The Web has clearly 
            supplanted the book as &quot;ubiquitous multimedia.&quot; In reinventing 
            emblems, it seemed natural to use digital imagery, animation, sound, 
            and links, which are difficult or impossible in a book. </p>

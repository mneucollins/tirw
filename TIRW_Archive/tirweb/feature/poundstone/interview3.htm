          <p><b>The Interview</b></p>
          <p><b>Brian Stefans</b>: I've been interested in the work of Ian Hamilton 
            Finlay for some time, not only in terms of his relationship to concrete 
            poetry and the curious &quot;non-secular&quot; nature of his aesthetics, 
            which I read partly as a response to globilization, but also in his 
            work with Scottish dialect poetry and, of course, his work with the 
            emblem. In your introduction above, you didn't mention Finlay, nor 
            any other poets beyond the Oulipo writers and Emily Dickinson. Do 
            you feel any affinity with any particular visual or non-visual poet 
            or poetry? Outside of Ruscha, are there other visual artists working 
            with language whom you think particularly relevant to your work?</p>
          <p><b>William Poundstone:</b> Finlay has been a big influence on me, 
            for pretty much the same reasons. I suppose I'm as mystified (alarmed?) 
            as anyone at Finlay's &quot;non-secular&quot; philosophy/politics/aesthetics 
            (or maybe, as mystified and alarmed as Finlay intends me to be). What 
            bothers certain people about Finlay is something I actually find interesting: 
            the way his work purports to be propaganda for a cause that is so 
            well known to the audience &quot;that it needs no introduction.&quot; 
            Many of Finlay's pieces are &quot;Nike ads.&quot; They do not say 
            much, as if confident that they do not need to say much. As Tom Lubbock 
            said, Finlay acts like he's commenting on this pre-existing discourse 
            that doesn't exist.</p>
          <p>I think this is interesting because it cuts to the central paradox 
            of visual poetry, the incommensurability of the visual and the intellectual. 
            To me concrete poetry succeeds because of a certain disjunction between 
            image and text. I think that is why so many of the early landmark 
            works used typography from advertising and packaging. Pignatari's 
            Coca-Cola poem was able to invoke one set of cultural expectations 
            with the typography and play them against the entirely different meanings 
            of its text. Finlay achieves a comparable effect in an even more novel 
            way, by attaching these wholly outre messages to an aestheticizing 
            style. In a way, Finlay's art is about the purposeful misreading of 
            art. </p>
          <p>Come to think of it, the element of faux propaganda also exists in 
            the work of another artist/poet I admire, <a href="http://www.mcad.edu/home/faculty/szyhalski/Piotr" target="_blank">Piotr 
            Szyhalski</a>. Szyhalski plays with the Polish and Soviet bloc poster 
            tradition. Like Finlay's, Szyhalski's work addresses issues of power 
            (and revolution and even weaponry.) It doesn't seem to bother people 
            as much Finlay's work, though, maybe because Szyhalski is a bit more 
            clearly distanced from his messages.</p>
          <p>I read lots of non-visual poetry, but I don't see it as having a 
            perceptible &quot;influence&quot; on what I do, save maybe in the 
            loosest sense. I'm vastly more influenced by looking at the work of 
            other Web artists: Like most of us, I guess, I see a cool effect and 
            wonder what I could do with it. I suppose that sounds terrible to 
            be so concerned with medium-specific gimmicks, but really, all art 
            is about medium-specific gimmicks. We're still where cinema was in 
            Lumiere's day, trying to work out the gimmick set. </p>
          <p>Among non-Web people normally categorized as visual poets as opposed 
            to visual artists (the distinction being mainly one of &quot;marketing&quot;) 
            I would especially mention Tom Phillips and Gabriel Pomerand. Among 
            non-Web visual artists who use text, I would cite practically all 
            the Los Angeles school of text art, from Baldessari to Alexis Smith, 
            Raymond Pettibon, and Larry Johnson. I am not sure why the way artists 
            use text in Los Angeles seems different from elsewhere -- for obviously 
            this is an utterly disparate bunch -- but it does seem different in 
            aim from what, oh, Jenny Holzer or Douglas Kosuth do with text. </p>
          <p>Going back further, I like most of the great Russian and German innovators 
            of typography. I especially like Wyndham Lewis.</p>
          <p><b>BS: </b>Thinking in particular about your &quot;Androgyne with 
            a Gun,&quot; do you think there is something peculiar to digital technology 
            that calls for the &quot;morphing&quot; together of identity structures 
            once considered whole and inviolable, on the one hand, or simpy bogus 
            chimeras on the other? That is, if one were to understand certain 
            elements of postmodernism as suggesting that the &quot;self&quot; 
            is really a congeries of socially determined fragments, and that one's 
            sense of identity was a romantic and doomed attempt to make them cohere 
            for the sake of &quot;identity,&quot; do you think that the internet 
            and digital representation has suggested the necessity for something 
            else entirely -- a &quot;cyborg&quot; identity, perhaps? I'm not phrasing 
            this very well -- perhaps it's not an element of your work. How do 
            you find your images working in a social realm -- is there an oppositional 
            element there?</p>
          <p><b>WP: </b>One thing that I think is intrinsically digital is the 
            idea of the continuum. With the androgynes, for instance, the morphing 
            program can generate any numerically specified mixture of genders 
            whatsoever, say 46% female and 54% male. That would be a challenge 
            to do in an oil painting or a non-digital photograph. The effect of 
            &quot;Androgyne with a Gun&quot; hinges at least partly on the idea 
            that, whether gay or straight, male or female, there's no cultural 
            autopilot response to cheesecake images of androgynes. Culture is 
            a useful fiction that supplies absolutes. With its &quot;slippery&quot; 
            way of denying categories, digital art often stands in opposition 
            to culture (&quot;Arithmetic is the enemy of culture,&quot; one of 
            my emblems reads.) </p>
          <p>I think it is legitimate to read much digital art, and especially, 
            the whole Web/cyberpunk culture, as an illustration of postmodern 
            identity theories (&quot;On the Web, no one knows you're a dog.&quot;) 
            It's worth noting that as &quot;treatment&quot; under British law 
            proscribing homosexuality, computer pioneer Alan Turing was forced 
            to take female hormones. In the famous 1950 paper describing the &quot;Turing 
            test&quot; (the cornerstone of the field of A.I.), Turing starts by 
            describing an &quot;imitation game&quot; in which people, communicating 
            only by keyboard, attempt to disguise their gender--a &quot;game&quot; 
            that is being played in today's chat rooms all the time. Identity 
            issues have been tied up with the digital realm from its inception.</p>
          <p>All this said, I don't mean to oversell the novelty of digital technology, 
            either. Susan Sontag complained that practically all modern photography 
            rehashes surrealism. That is equally (partly) true of digital art. 
            It uses a technology that is especially well suited to the surrealists'/Oulipians' 
            old tricks--the chimera, the &quot;irrational&quot; juxtaposition. 
            I would also tend to position my androgyne images within the culture 
            of drag. There is a long tradition of defying gender roles through 
            whatever &quot;technologies&quot; are available. </p>
          <p><b>BS: </b>One of the questions that seems to be bugging people about 
            digital technology is whether there is anything that can suggest a 
            &quot;break&quot; with pre-digital art practices. Lev Manovich's book 
            <i>The Language of New Media,</i> for instance, suggests that digital 
            filmmaking is closer to painting than photography, or even more to 
            animation than filmmaking--not so much a break as a confluence and 
            fuller realization of recognizable techniques. Your use of the word 
            &quot;continuum&quot; suggests that there is a &quot;break&quot; with 
            the time-honored practice of collage aesthetics, and, in your intro 
            paragraphs above, you write that you can &quot;rip-off&quot; someone's 
            pre-digital ideas and follow-through on their implications without 
            being derivative. What's your sense of how this period in art-making 
            can be characterized by the rise of affordable digital creation machines 
            for artists? Do you think that there is a way that all art-making 
            of the next decades or so will be affected by these technologies, 
            whether the artist uses them or not?</p>
          <p><b>WP: </b>There is a real break with the pre-digital past. Your 
            mention of collage is pertinent: A lot of people could see PhotoShop 
            only in terms of collage. They had the reaction, &quot;Well, it's 
            too bad Hannah Hoch didn't have this in the twenties, but what are 
            'serious' artists going to do with it today?&quot; And as far as I 
            can tell, pre-digital photocollages have been almost totally irrelevant 
            to digital art. The genius of photocollage was how both its technical 
            strengths and weaknesses played into the artistic conversation of 
            the time (just by doing what was easy with scissors and paste, you 
            got instant &quot;cubism&quot; or instant &quot;dada.&quot;) Digital 
            art also follows the line of least resistance. We tend to make the 
            most of the transformations that are easy to do with current tools. 
            But its strengths are very different from what went before. In collage 
            the question you keep asking yourself is always &quot;what?&quot; 
            -- what do I combine with this? In digital art, the most common questions 
            are almost always of the form &quot;how much?&quot; You are dragging 
            a slider on a continuum and trying to decide what is optimal. It's 
            a different way of working and thinking.</p>
          <p>I think digital art will affect all art-making, if it hasn't already. 
            By that I just mean that there is this critical mass of artists working 
            digitally, and their work ultimately influences everyone. Maybe this 
            is easiest to see in photography. Just as the use of color changed 
            the way we see black and white, digitally edited photographs are changing 
            the way we view non-digital. Even if your reaction is to throw up 
            your hands and say you want no part of digital photography, that in 
            itself becomes a statement. And if you see yourself as a creative 
            photographer, you will find other ways to be creative. So by &quot;influence&quot; 
            I don't mean that all art will look more like digital art (assuming 
            it's got a &quot;look&quot;.) Some art will strive to look less like 
            digital. The way a new technology Influences late- and non-adopters 
            is a complicated thing, part Ludditism and part Stockholm syndrome. 
            I think, though, that all art will be different than it would have 
            been, had digital art not existed. <a href="interview4.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

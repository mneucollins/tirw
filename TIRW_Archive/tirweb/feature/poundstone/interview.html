            BY BRIAN KIM STEFANS</b></p>
          <p align="center"><b><img src="emb.gif" width="250" height="86" alt="image from &quot;New Digital Emblems&quot; by William Poundstone"> 
            </b></p>
          <p align="left"> I first came upon William Poundstone's work when Kenneth 
            Goldsmith posted alink to Poundstone's massive Shockwave site, &quot;<a href="http://www.williampoundstone.net" target="_blank">New 
            Digital Emblems</a>,&quot; on the<br>
            <a href="http://www.ubu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuweb</a> listserv. 
          </p>
          <p>This piece seemed to go against the grain of much internet text art 
            and poetry at the time in several ways. For one, it involved little 
            HTML, but was entirely contained within the Shockwave file, making 
            it inaccessible to web spiders and text algorithms - that is, it has 
            a &quot;gated community&quot; effect to those of us that like to pillage 
            other web sites for texts for our own works. Further, it was all very 
            carefully &quot;written,&quot; not adherent to random or algorithmic 
            processes and avoiding anything suggesting &quot;deconstruction,&quot; 
            and the imagery and text all had a cypher-like quality, rather than 
            being oriented toward surface effects or the one-liner ethos of much 
            concrete poetry.</p>
          <p>The &quot;New Digital Emblems&quot; site also foregoes the feel of 
            web art sites that celebrate digital technology with beautiful, often 
            mystifying, interfaces, imagery that suggests a career in the graphic 
            arts, and heavy sound elements, often of a light industrial, techno 
            feel. </p>
          <p>I love these kinds of sites, but Poundstone's project, despite its 
            being &quot;multimedia,&quot; was startling for avoiding any of the 
            trappings of techno-culture, while at the same time suggesting a deeper 
            historical tradition for the &quot;interface&quot; - indeed, suggesting 
            the heroic emblem, with its iconic image, motto, and explanatory text, 
            as being a pre-digital analog. </p>
          <p>What is most striking, though, once you reach the main interface--a 
            great spiral bedecked with largish circular icons and emanating from 
            a conch shell in the middle--is the easy dexterity with which Poundstone 
            negotiates several different aesthetic traditions: poetic and imagistic 
            traditions dating back to the Rennaissance, modernist/postmodern photography, 
            collage and literature (Surrealism and Oulipo, most obviously), not 
            to mention the developing traditions of web art itself which he seemed 
            instictively to know how to exploit to create an unmistakably &quot;literary&quot; 
            site that, nonetheless, would not have been done justice in a book. 
          </p>
          <p>I wrote to Poundstone recently, with the hope of having him agree 
            to be interviewed. After breaking the ice with a few preliminary emails, 
            but before I had a chance to assemble any interview questions, he 
            sent me a personal introduction. It appears here, somewhat revised.

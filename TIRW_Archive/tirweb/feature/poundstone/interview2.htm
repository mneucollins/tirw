          <p>Here's a little background on my somewhat unusual career. Basically 
            I'm a visual artist who writes books as &quot;day job.&quot; Most 
            of my art is digitally composed photographs or lightbox transparencies. 
            I use a Tachihara 4 by 5 view camera (it's still a lot more flexible 
            and higher-res than digital). Though nearly all of my art is photographically 
            derived, it often doesn't look &quot;photographic.&quot; And of course 
            a lot of it combines text with image. I suppose this most immediately 
            alludes to the 1960s-vintage L.A. art tradition of same (I live in 
            Los Angeles). <a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('landscape_view.jpg','landscape','width=615,height=440')">This 
            one</a>, from a series of lightbox transparencies called &quot;Landscape 
            Views,&quot; sort of turns the Ruscha Hollywood sign around.</p>
          <p>Some of my stuff is closer to old-school concrete poetry. &quot;<a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('anagram.htm','anagram','width=615,height=495')">Untitled 
            Anagram Poem</a>&quot; is from a series commemorating outsider writers 
            I admire. In this case, the text is an anagram of &quot;Francis McElroy.&quot;</p>
          <p>"<a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('androgyne.htm','androg','width=350,height=615')">Androgyne 
            with a Gun</a>&quot; is from a group of androgyne portraits. As a 
            gay man, I've always been interested in the treatment of gender in 
            photography. For each of these portraits, I shot a male and a female 
            model in identical poses derived from pornography, advertising, or 
            the George Platt Lynes school of arty photography. The lighting and 
            camera placement had to be identical, too, and then the male and female 
            images were morphed.</p>
          <p>I've used similar techniques with still-lifes. &quot;<a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('redpepper.htm','pepper','width=615,height=495')">Red 
            Pepper</a>&quot; plays on the cliche of the eroticized still-life 
            (I made it after reading Alexander Nemerov's book on Raphaelle Peale.) 
            I was wondering how much I could make a bell pepper look like a human 
            back and still look like a &quot;straight&quot; photograph. In this 
            image, the shape of the pepper is almost entirely from a human model, 
            with the pepper's color and texture mapped onto it.</p>
          <p>In general, I try to keep current in the sorts of software being 
            used in film effects, advertising, TV graphics, and other popular 
            media: tools that normally aren't associated with &quot;high&quot; 
            art, yet which are already a part of the popular visual lexicon. These 
            seem like a rich field simply because they haven't been explored quite 
            so much. For much the same reason, I've followed web art and literature 
            closely since its inception. (I also like the luminance of the computer 
            screen, more like a lightbox than the printed page or color photograph.) 
            My first web project (c. 1996?) was a very simple interactive text 
            html with no pictures! You were presented with a sentence drawn from 
            supermarket tabloids. Clicking on a word led to another sentence having 
            to do with the chosen word, and so on. It was a &quot;multiple-choice 
            narrative&quot; except that instead of having explicit choices, you 
            clicked on whatever word most appealed to you. The result was interesting, 
            or so I thought at the time, for being in a middle ground between 
            making sense and not making sense. But that piece is no longer up, 
            and I think I've lost it through successive hard disk crashes and 
            changes of ISPs.</p>
          <p>The two pieces you mentioned (&quot;<a href="http://www.williampoundstone.net/" target="_blank">New 
            Digital Emblems</a>&quot; and the series at Ubu.com) are the only 
            real web projects I've got up now. Anticipating your questions, let 
            me give a little background on them. The UbuWeb pieces are inspired 
            by Al Hanson's Fluxus-era collages. Hanson did these amazing collages 
            using, for instance, the wrappers from Hershey's chocolate bars. Hanson 
            would cut up the wrapper so that you don't see the complete word, 
            just fragments like &quot;HER&quot; and &quot;SHE&quot; and &quot;HEY.&quot; 
            As I recall, one of these collages formed the silhouette of a shapely 
            woman -- a really silly idea, like a graphic from a James Bond movie 
            title, that also tied into de Kooning-esque gynecophobia. But mainly, 
            it was a masterpiece of economy of means.</p>
          <p>One of the nice things about our digital zeitgeist is that you can 
            rip off someone's pre-digital idea and, by the time you've translated 
            it to an .swf, it doesn't seem like such a rip-off. (Or maybe that's 
            what Delacroix meant when he said that you have to be able to recognize 
            when a predecessor hasn't gone far enough.) I figured that (a) PhotoShop 
            would make it so much easier to do the cutting and pasting Hanson 
            did with scissors and paste and (b) instead of a still collage, you 
            could have an animation. The introduction of the time dimension seemed 
            to enhance the poem-nature of the results. They are more poems and 
            less pictures than Hanson's collages.</p>
          <p>From the textual side of things, this is close to an anagram poem. 
            It's technically what the Oulipo call a &quot;beautiful in-law.&quot; 
            This is where you compose a text under the arbitrary constraint that 
            you can use only the letters existing in another, given text. In other 
            words, if working with the &quot;Mr Goodbar&quot; label, I can use 
            only letters that appear in that label--I don't invent letterforms--but, 
            unlike an anagram, I don't have to use all the given letters, and 
            I can use letters more often than they appear the label. As with all 
            these Oulipian exercises, the point is to try to say something even 
            as you're being throttled by this essentially pointless restriction.</p>
          <p>Visually, I think the results work best when you can't quite recognize 
            the product whose typography is used. There is then this nagging, 
            subliminal familiarity--Freud's sense of the &quot;uncanny.&quot; 
            There is a museum of typography on American consumer product labels, 
            and we never see it because we've learned to tune it out. I say &quot;museum&quot; 
            because it's not all contemporary. There are labels and logos that 
            have been unchanged in decades, preserving echoes of fifties biomorphism, 
            constructivism, and everything else.</p>
          <p>The &quot;New Digital Emblems&quot; site of course attests to my 
            interest in emblems. Like much that I admire, emblems are really on 
            the margins of art and literary history. Pre the dot.com bust, so 
            much that was written about the web struck me as wrong-headed. People 
            imputed what I can only call &quot;magic&quot; to web's feature set. 
            Low-cost-per-million multimedia interactivity was going to change 
            the world. I knew that people had said similar things about the emblem, 
            and had offered, in outline, many of the same reasons for it. So the 
            emblem, often literally magical, became a caricature of the web.</p>
          <p>As your Arras site link aptly describes it, &quot;New Digital Emblems&quot; 
            is &quot;quasi-didactic.&quot; It has relatively a lot of text (I 
            think I computed 15,000 words total?), and big chunks of text are 
            normally outre for web art or web anything. This emulates/parodies 
            the commentary, often lengthy (and often in verse) that accompanied 
            the old emblem books. The emblem anticipated our culture of criticism, 
            the idea that a poem or novel or film is valued by how much can be 
            written about it. Emblems helped shape the idea that a work of art 
            can't just be something, it's got to be this mystery that resists 
            any definitive explanation. These values are still defining web art 
            and literature. The ideal is so often a site that is different every 
            time you visit and which can never be fully experienced. All of which 
            is fine, assuming that the site really is an endless cornucopia of 
            good and original context. Which is unlikely. So often, sites are 
            only being coy--withholding content and dispensing it to those who 
            run a maze of links and clicks. This &quot;I know something you don't&quot; 
            smugness is equally behind the emblem books.</p>
          <p>As far as I can tell, the audience for my books is largely disjoint 
            from my art. Most of them are on science with a philosophic slant 
            of one kind or another. A couple were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize: 
            Labyrinths of Reason, which is on the implications of paradoxes for 
            the philosophy of science, and The Recursive Universe, about the use 
            of computer simulations as a tool for understanding the nature of 
            physical law. I also do occasional book reviews and magazine pieces.</p>
          <p>Another piece you might want to look at is &quot;<a href="http://www.williampoundstone.net/White_Poem.html" target="_blank">White 
            Poem</a>&quot;. The poem text is a so-called travesty, that is, a 
            computer-generated text that obeys the statistics of a given input 
            text. The idea was conceived by Claude Shannon way back in mainframe 
            days, and Shannon's work was influential with the Cage-Rauschenberg 
            crowd. I'm working on a series of these travesty poems currently. 
            My modus operandi is to pick a specific theme--in this case, whiteness, 
            as in Emily Dickinson's lace-white Indian Pipe--and then assemble 
            a large and diverse assortment of quotes bearing on that theme. (I 
            keep a &quot;commonplace book&quot; so it's easy to search for every 
            incidental mention of &quot;white.&quot;) These quotes are input into 
            the travesty program. The program outputs a kind of marvelous rant 
            on the chosen theme, from which I pick the phrases I want to use in 
            the poem. <a href="interview3.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<!--ìSwansea is the graveyard of ambition,ìwrote Dylan Thomas. The civic authorities of the Welsh seaport reacted by commissioning a public artwork.Spelled out in brass letters on a granite pavement in Swansea City Centre are words that might be supposed to compensate for the alleged defect without admitting any faultónor alluding to the poet or comment that motivated it. The inscription reads: AMBITION IS CRITICALThe inscription was more than damage controlóit was a stroke of marketing geniusIn recent years Swansea has adopted the inscription as the centerpiece of aneconomic development campaignPromoting itself as the ìCity of Ambitionî<>to a generation unaware of Thomasë slurmedical billingwebsite designcomponent assemblyfilm & video productionbiotechnologybroadbandSwansea has attracted £160 million investment in smokestack-free industrieswhile preserving quality of lifeÖ[The bottle imp illustrates Swanseaís growth with a pneumatically animated backdrop]But there is one black cloud in the blue sky of Swanseaís futuredisaffected youthalcoholdrugsgraffitigangsnihilismSwansea City Centre has become a gathering spot for truants, vagrants, and drug users. ìEvenings the area is practically deserted,î stated Andrew Wilson, 52, ìand the boys there are capable of anything in the shape of crime.î Another resident complained of abusive boys ìwho always frequent the same spot, like trolls.î Though usually empty of any visible threat, the streets are rarely frequented by those with no business in the area. Such women as are seen in the district keep close watch on their pocketbooks. Liquor bottles are often found on the ìambitionî inscriptionóas if in mockery of Thomasí premature death from alcoholism. Once, vandals spray-painted the inscription to read ìAmbition is Crap.îParents worry that Dylan Thomas has become a role model for kids ìwho just want to party.îI am a Welshman.I am a drunkard.I am a lover of the human race, especially of women. 3óDylan ThomasThe bottle imp reproduces the inscription in miniatureó The letters are alnico magnets anodized to brass finish and held in place by magnets concealed beneath the hollow ceramic pavement. A mechanism rearranges the letters to form anagrams (ostensibly in the voice of Thomas) causing the viewer to question the meaning and validity of the inscription.Periodically, a porcelain reproduction of the cross on Thomasí grave plummets through the waterÖreminding the viewer that the soil of South Wales has literally become the graveyard of  a poetís ambition. -->

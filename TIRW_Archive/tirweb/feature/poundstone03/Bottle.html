By changing the fluid pressure of the container, the figure may be made to rise and descend. The device has been linked to the name of RÈne Descartes since the 17th century, though it is not mentioned in Descartesí writings and any connection is obscure. Today bottle imps are occasionally constructed as school îscience projects.î In literature, the bottle imp has some notoriety for its role in Raymond Rousselís 1914 novel, Locus Solus. The novel concerns a wealthy gentleman scientist, Cantarel, who has built a collection of absurd automata. Among them is a set of seven bottle imps that act out perversely obscure incidents from history and folklore. îBottle impî is a somewhat inelegant translation of Rousselís French term îludion,î which can also mean an actor, fool, or wandering entertainer. Further confusing the matter for some English readers is a Robert Louis Stevenson story, îThe Bottle Imp.î Well known in its time, Stevensonís tale (of an evil genie in a bottle) has nothing to do with the pseudocartesian toy.Why should I care, exactly?This website semi-facetiously adopts Rousselís bottle imps as a model for thinking about electronic literature. As a story about machines that tell stories, Locus Solus addresses issues of authenticity and artifice, word and image, and fiction and truth. The main thing about directing, John Ford said, is to ìphotograph the peopleís eyes.î Most electronic literature rejects this cinematic dictum. In contrast to film, video, or conventional animation, eLit is form of visual story-telling in which characters are mostly invisible, blurred, or glanced from a distance. Though this is sometimes put down to temporary limitations of posing and animation software, eLit is fundamentally a medium of artificeóof symbols that are perceived as symbols.Any discussion of artifice in literature might well begin with Raymond Roussel. Rousselís work, and especially his novel Locus Solus, presents the paradox of a visually rich narrative in which human beings are strangely tangential.  is mainly about machines (or in one chapter, dead people who been reanimated into a mechanical, puppet-like simulation of life.) Roussel presents a world of avatars, virtual personages that look, move, and talk like people; beings capable of soliloquies though not conversation or introspection. This could equally describe the digital realm today. Like electronic literature, Rousselís writing often evokes the uncanny power of text rendered concrete. Locus Soluspresents a succession of visual images of isolated and inexplicable texts: the word ìNOWî spelled out in clouds,  ìDOUBTî in bubbles, ìCOWARDî in nettle-stung skin. Each demands a web of linked digressions that follow in due course yet ultimately fail to explain anything. The concrete text and labyrinthine links of eLit explore similar territory.The three stories here play with both the deeper and more superficial parallels between Roussel and eLit (notably, the self-contained, endlessly looping narrative, the loud proclamation of artifice, and the blurring of fact and fiction.)Q. What is a Cartesian Devil?A. A bottle imp (q.v.)RenÈ Descartes probably never knew of what we now call a Cartesian devil or diver (or bottle imp). In 1648 Raffaelo Maggiotti, a student of Galileoís, described the device and said he invented it. There is no reason to doubt this claim. A 1731 letter to the Royal Society of London, by a Mr. Triewald, used the name ìCartesian devilî as if it were in general use. The name may allude to Descartesí discredited theory of physics. Descartes proposed that the universe is filled with an invisible celestial fluid. Motion and other physical phenomena are the consequences of vortices in this fluid. The Cartesian devil loosely illustrates this notion: It moves through a fluid medium, propelled by invisible forces.Q. Does this website make use of meaningless coincidence?A. Yes.As revealed posthumously in How I Wrote Certain of My Books, Raymond Roussel would randomly pick two words or phrases that sounded similar but had different meaningsósuch as locksand lox{except that Roussel used French words}Roussel then constructed a story to link the two meanings.In a somewhat opaque passage, Foucault relates this method to Rousselís suicide, and finds mythic significance in the coincidence that Rousselís body was discovered on the threshold of a locked door.This site is loosely structured around the similarity of the terms CARTESIAN SUBJECTCARTESIAN DEVILÖwhich can be linked via the figures of Descartes, Foucault, and Rousselfounded the Western tradition of rationalist philosophy with his notion of self as an integrated and rational being [the CARTESIAN SUBJECT.] Descartes believed that REASON was sufficient for distinguishing reality from ILLUSION. a critic of Cartesian philosophy, wrote a celebrated history of MADNESS in which he charged that DESCARTESí skeptical inquiry had failed to consider the possibility of oneís insanity. Foucaultís first book was a study of ROUSSELwrote Locus Solus, a novel that (unintentionally?) reflects Western ambivalence about REASON and MADNESS. The story concerns a ìmad scientistî who constructs story-telling machines and ILLUSIONS.  Among them is a set of bottle imps or CARTESIAN DEVILSHow do I know what is real?In his Meditations, Descartes adopts the premise that the universe is an illusion created by an evil genie to deceive him. He poses the question: how can I know what is real? This train of thought leads to doubts so serious that îit feels as if I have fallen unexpectedly into a deep whirlpool which tumbles me around so that I can neither stand on the bottom nor swim up to the top.îFrench critics have often adopted similar analogies in writing of Roussel, who is said to explore the ìabyssesî in our concept of reality. Rousselís obsession with similar words denoting dissimilar things can been taken as a demonstration of the fallibility of language and thus of linear, discourse-based reason. Each of Rousselís tales literally fills a gap in our conceptualization of the world. Foucault particularly championed the view of Roussel as diver in the Cartesian abyss. Do the insane serve a purpose?Michel Foucaultís critique of the Cartesian subject stresses a lacuna in Descartesí argument. Though Descartes is willing to contemplate that an evil genie has deceived his senses, he fails to allow for the parallel and seemingly natural possibility that he might be deluded or mad. This leads Foucault into a historical study of madness in the age of reason. Foucault asserts that the insane were not institutionalized until the 1600s. Prior to that time, the ìfoolî or ìvillage idiotî served a role as critic of social institutions, along other marginalized groups such as homosexuals, libertines, dwarfs, and wandering entertainers. Foucault found in Roussel a kind of anti-Cartesian subjectóone who might, through ìmadness,î comment on the institutions of literature. [Roussel sought psychiatric help for depression and was institutionalized in the same asylum where Cocteau was being treated for opium addiction. At the 1911-12 stage production of Impressions of Africa, the French press called Roussel a madman.]Is virtual reality a good thing?What we would now call virtual reality is a prominent motif in Rousselís work. Locus Solus consists largely of a transcript of Canterelís narratives explaining his automata, which have been created solely to enact other narratives. Nothing ìrealî happens. The action, such as it is, is all virtual, several times over.Some of Rousselís simulacra oddly echo Descartes and his evil genie. In Impressions of Africa, an insane man is cured by the theatrical reenactment of the events responsible for his madness. Likewise, describes a mad sculptor, who believes heís Leonardo da Vinci, being cured by a phonographic simulation of his daughterís voice. Another chapter of  concerns a group of corpses brought back to life in stage-set reproductions of their former homes where paid actors portray their friends and relatives so that they may relive their lives. In a near-opposite of Descartes, Roussel thus has immersive multi-media illusion restore reason to the mad. In this, Roussel was probably influenced by Wagnerian Gesamkunstwerk and psychoanalysis. In Descartesí version of îvirtual reality,î reason is able to discern elements of reality even from an immersive illusion. Just as the fantastic objects of a dream are not totally novel but are based on real objects, he contends, so an illusion must betray something of the underlying reality. ìFor even when painters try to create sirens and satyrs with the most extraordinary bodies, they cannot give them natures which are new in all respects; they simply jumble up the limbs of different animals.î Q. Why is some on-screen text so hard to read?Like the hardware underlying electronic literature, Rousselís bottle imps are story-telling automata. They combine text, image, motion, and sound and seem to be making a point by their lack of human presence. Rousselís implementation of text is particularly eccentric. Some of the bottle imps ìspeakî by issuing precisely engineered patterns of bubbles. As these rise to the surface, they form fleeting letters and words. Bubbles are a traditional symbol of evanescence and vanity. With this image Roussel anticipates todayís concern with challenging the stability of text in print media. The amusing impracticality of Rousselís bubble text is an uneasy prefiguration of the realities of reading words that move and morph, linger too long or vanish too quickly.

Why do time and space seem disjointed?Everything has stopped, everything goes on reproducing itself, and the childís stick is always raised above the leaning hoop, and the spray of the motionless wave is about to fall.óAlain Robbe-Grillet,Enigme et Transparence chez Raymond Roussel The true writer has nothing to sayDescartes devised the ìCartesian coordinatesî used to locate objects in space. Most fiction recounts significant actions of characters through space and time. Rousselís înoncartesianî narratives appealed, in turn, to thesurrealistsand the practitioners of the nouveau romanCiting Roussel as precedent, Robbe-Grillet advocated a literature lacking in plot, psychological insight, coherent sense of time, and above all meaning: îThe true writer has nothing to say.îLocus Solus is really about inanimate objects, namely the bottle imps and other story-telling illusions. The experience of the novelís narratives-within-narratives is fractured. Roussel rehearses each bottle imp tale twice. First we share the visitorsí mystification as the bottle impsí actions are described. The second telling records Canterelís explanations for the illusions. The effect is less that of a story than of a puzzle in which initially odd or meaningless details acquire meaning. For better or worse, this is how much electronic literature works. the storiesthemselvesElements of Rousselís narrative structure are  followed here. The three tales are, on the one hand, proposals for story-telling automata; and, on the other hand, always already the stories themselves, set somewhere else in space and time (and eternally looping in ìourî time frame.) A. Is the information in this website accurate?Descartesí Meditations is above all concerned with separating fact from fiction through the agency of reason. Roussel uses reason as an agency for creating fiction, and especially, for blurring the distinction between fiction and nonfiction. Any reader of Roussel understands that Locus Solus is a novel. Canterel is not a real person, and the frame story did not really happen. It is not difficult to be deceived by the stories enacted by the bottle imps, though. They involve ìrealî figures like Voltaire, Wagner, and Alexander the Great. Roussel/Canterel credits his sources, as in a work of nonfiction. Actually, Roussel uses real people and facts to lend credibility to his falsehoods. He is faithful only to the cryptic and clandestine word games described in How I Wrote Certain of My Books. [This echoes the hidden agendas of the Web, todayís ultimate unreliable narrator.]-->

<!--tahselriVPiero di Cosimotook delight in allmanner of freaks and curiosities of nature.ìHe never let his garden be dug or his vines pruned, but was content to see everything run wild, like his own nature.îWhenever Piero saw anything curiousóbe it an oak gall or a two-headed calfóhe would mention it in conversation for weeks afterward, to the point where it became tedious to everyone.Strangest of Pieroís obsessions was a wall where, by long custom, the sick of the city had aimed their spittle.To Pieroís eyes, fantastic imagesdanced on the crumbling, mucus-encrusted surface. In this way did Piero find subjects for his art, which was praised for its novelty of invention.One day Piero perceived in the wall the image of a sea monster.Its form perfectly combined all that is gross and appalling in nature. Seized with a frenzy, Piero painted the creature and presented it to Giuliano de Medici. Giuliano accepted the painting and put it in a closet.           It was covered with a green cloth.In truth, no one could look upon the picture without disgust, so uncompromisingly had Piero executed his vision.At Cosimo de Mediciís death, or at any rate prior to 1568here Vasari is confused about dates (?)[Catherine de Medici[who had been frightened by the picture as a girl] returned the painting to the wall that had originally inspired it,where it was spat upon by the rabbleÖÖfromwhich Vasari drew a moral about too-extremeeccentricityin artThe bottle imp evokes this tale with a stoneware model of Pieroís wall. Floating in front of the wall are curious images representing the figments of Pieroís imagination.each cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyEach figure is folded into a compact pellet and attached to a Cartesian diver.each cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyeach cutfrom foil of nickel-titanium memory alloyPeriodically, an electric heater warms the wateró6868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868686868causing the foil to unfold to its former size and permitting a crude effect of animation. 6868686868Then a charge of carbon dioxide bubbles cools the water787878787878787878causing the figures to shrink gradually awayó7878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878787878after the fashion of eccentric visions--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"

<!--Nicolas Ferrywas one of three dwarfs born to humble parents in the Vosges.From childhood he possessed handsome, well-proportioned features.This, as well the publication of his deformity by Geffroi, the chemist, ensured Ferryís celebrity and brought him to the attention of the highest circles of society.Stanislas I Leszczynski[Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland]Öwho had retired to devote himself to science and philanthropy[Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland]established his court in LunÈville, France[Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland][Exiled king of Poland]where he became aware of Ferryís size and beautyto make a long story shortFerry become Stanislasí court dwarf óearning the prized nickname ìBÈbÈî for his stature (less than 30 inches tall) and cherubic countenance.The nickname was all too fitting.BÈbÈ was given to temper tantrums and childish outbursts.His mental capacity, regrettably, never exceeded that of a very small child.These failings, though existing to a pronounced degree, were tolerated as consequences of the size of the brain pan (estimated by Geffroi to be equal to that of a spaniel.)On account of this,was indulged and pampered endlesslybecoming, in effect, a grotesquely spoiled child.There matters stood until 1755, or possibly 1756, when a Countess Humieska paid a visit to LunÈvillebringing among her possessions a certain ìJoujou,î or Joseph Boruwlaski, a male dwarf approximately twenty-four inches tall. Joujou was of trim, athletic proportions and comely in appearance.moreovermoreovermoreovermoreovermoreovermoreoverJoujou was ascheerful, intelligent, witty, even-tempered, generous, brave, and honest as BÈbÈ was brooding, stupid, dull, intractable, mean, craven, and deceitful.LunÈville society was not so large as to permit two celebrated dwarfs, resident simultaneously, not to meet.The Bottle Imp represents the consequences of that meeting.When Joujou paid audience to Stanislas,in the company of BÈbÈ,the differences between the dwarfs were noted and commented upon.who had previously been the very paragon of smallness(indeed, his name was applied humorously in LunÈville to anything of miniscule scale, sentient or not)now seemed less remarkablein comparison to the yet-smaller JoujouSome onlookers felt that only Joujou was a true marvel of natureóand{merely a person whose growth had been stunted to a more or less considerable and tragic degree.t was in character, however, that the contrasts were most evident.Where BÈbÈís failings had formerly been excused on account of his cranial capacity, they became infinitely harder to accept given the example of Joujouís intelligent and magnanimous nature, originating, as it did, in a brain no larger than a green apple. Where BÈbÈís failings had formerly been excused on account of his cranial capacity, they became infinitely harder to bear given the example of Joujouís intelligent and magnanimous nature, originating, as it did, in a brain no larger than a green apple. Matters came to a head at a dinner in which the conversation turned to the topic of the mental capacities of dwarfs. Naturally, Stanislas began by championing his own dwarf. His chauvinism melted as Joujou regaled the company with reports of his progress in the arts and sciences. inally, Stanislas, vexed with the latest outburst from BÈbÈ (who was not so dull as to fail to sense the direction of the kingís favors) said with more candor than tact:Voyez BÈbÈ, quelle diffÈrence il y a entre vous et Joujou; il est amiable, gai, amusant et instruit, tandis que vous, vous níÍtes quíune petite machine[Look BÈbÈ, what a difference there is between you and Joujou; he is friendly, cheerful, fun, and educated, while youíre nothing but a little machine.]These words, all the more cutting for carrying the force of truth, appear on a banderole issuing from the mouth of Stanislas; and the awful sequel is enacted by the figurines of the dwarfs.BÈbÈ conceived the evil plan of throwing his rival into the fire.Pretending to have dropped important state documents in the fire, he asked Joujouís assistance in retrieving them.AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)Joujou repulsed the attack, pinning his assailant to the floor with a fireiron.AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDTHOUGH LARGER,BÈbÈ(SOFTENEDBY A LIFE OF WAS NO MATCH FOR JOUJOUINDOLENCE)AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDFlames are simulated by a stream of bubbles agitating gold tinsel.AFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDAFIERCEBATTLEENSUEDThe commotion brought back the kingwho commanded that BÈbÈ be punishedseverely. It was Joujou who objected. He pleaded leniency for BÈbÈ with such eloquence that the king could not but submit to his wishes. [The gist of his defense was that BÈbÈ had demonstrated himself to be bereft of moral sense and thus a creature to pitied by man and God.]By way of recompense Joujou asked only that BÈbÈ apologize in the kingís presence. This was done.ifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyifgracelesslyJoujouís assessment of BÈbÈ as an object of pity was prophetic.BÈbÈ died soon afterward, having by then attained the physical appearance of a tiny old man at the age of 23.BÈbÈís remains were preserved in cognac. Exhibited in a large bottle, this curious relic passed from wunderkammer to wunderkammer until 1896, when an Alsatian girl saw it at a country fair. Moved by pity, she led a drive to give BÈbÈ a proper burial in consecrated soil.BÈbÈís bones, however, were retained for their scientific value.BÈbÈís skeleton is now in the MusÈe de líHomme (next to that of a giant), and a wax image is in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Brunswick, both of which are to be consulted in the modeling of the bottle impís figure of BÈbÈ.-->

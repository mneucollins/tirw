          <p align="left"><b>Thomas Swiss:</b> Hi, Nicolas. We're very enchanted 
            by your work. We know you started out as a painter -- can you tell 
            us a little about how you see digital and Web-based art in relation 
            to your work as a painter?</p>
          <p align="left"><b>Nicolas Clauss:</b> I began painting in an abstract 
            way. Then I started using objects on the canvas and working more and 
            more with the texture and matter, including pumice powder and sand. 
            Then I found that I could use not only objects -- like brushes or 
            clothes -- but photographs as objects. </p>
          <p align="left">Objects took more and more space into my paintings until<br>
            I thought I might try to carry on with objects but without canvas. 
            I made some installations (<a href="http://www.flyingpuppet.com/herbeville/start.htm" target="_blank">http://www.flyingpuppet.com/herbeville/start.htm</a>) 
            where<br>
            photos were projected on old walls among other objects and fabrics. 
            I discovered with these installations that the spectator was interacting 
            with the space and the light whenever the spectator moved.</p>
          <p align="left">Digital and Web-based art came on my way quite naturally, 
            then, following these experiences: it allows me to figure the viewer 
            into the work. It allows me to bring the experience of and &quot;ideal&quot; 
            installation to the users.</p>
          <p align="left"></p>
          <p align="left"><b>TS:</b> At TIR Web, we're very interested in the 
            connection between language and image/sound in New Media work like 
            you own, Nicolas. In a piece like your <a href="http://www.flyingpuppet.com/shock/brushes.htm" target="_blank">&quot;Mechanical 
            Brushes&quot;</a>, how did you arrive at the concept of using language 
            in the way you do? How do you see the language functioning in this 
            piece? Or in others, like the first frame of &quot;Dervish&quot;?</p>
          <p align="left"><b>NC:</b> For me, words and language are only objects 
            like other objects -- with their stories or without. Sometimes I just 
            use words as a plastic form (as in &quot;Mechanical Brushes&quot; 
            ); sometimes I use words I found without knowing much about the context 
            for the words. In these cases, I'm paying homage to someone else's 
            words.... in a very magic-like, irrational way. </p>
          <p align="left">In &quot;Dervish Flowers,&quot; the background pictures 
            are photos from an installation I made. The words there were writen 
            by a man who spent a lot of his life in a mental institute. Some friends 
            who bought his house gave me many objects and letters of his. I've 
            made several paintings out of them and I like to put a few words of 
            his on the net pieces I do.... I like the idea of giving a second 
            life to something from him, even though he was a total stranger to 
            me.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>TS:</b> You collaborate a lot-- as many New Media 
            artists seem to. Can you talk about that process, especially working 
            with sound artists? </p>
          <p align="left"><b>NC:</b> I had been painting alone for 14 years. Now 
            I do works with others, but I continue doing works alone and I need 
            that -- in my mind I'm still a painter and a painter is alone. But 
            I have plenty of time, too, for shared works as well. I mostly work 
            with Jean-Jacques Birg&eacute;. Working with a sound artist like Jean-Jacques 
            is a great opportunity for me... I start doing a work first and then 
            he will appropriate the work to make music and suggest interactive 
            possibilities. I will then revise and we go back and forth...</p>
          <p align="left"><b>TS:</b> Most of your pieces are done in Shockwave. 
            Is there a reason why you like Shockwave and don't use, say, Flash?</p>
          <p align="left"><b>NC:</b> Why Shockwave? I began using it after I saw 
            the CDROM<br>
            &quot;Alphabet&quot; (Tivoli) which was made in Director. I then met 
            Murielle Lefevre, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Durieu and Jean-Jacques, 
            the authors of that amazing work, and they supported my working in 
            it. </p>
          <p align="left">I use Flash to make my dancers, but I don't program 
            with it. I quite dislike the vectorial look of Flash. The current 
            Flash trend on the Web is quite a bad thing, I think: too many Flash 
            clones.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>TS:</b> Last question: many of your pieces deal in 
            some way with &quot;dance.&quot; You even have a piece inspired by 
            the Bjork &quot;dance&quot; movie... why dance?</p>
          <p align="left"><b>NC:</b> It happened that I discovered dance late. 
            But when I did, I was interested in trying to give &quot;the dance&quot; 
            feeling through &quot;the mouse.&quot; To make people feel the sensuality 
            of dance... on screen. But, finally, as you might guess, I use dancers 
            as objects, too. </p>
          <p align="left"><b>TS:</b> Thanks, Nicolas. </p>

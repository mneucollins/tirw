            THE ELECTRONIC LITERATURE ORGANIZATION'S<br>
            STATE OF THE ARTS SYMPOSIUM, 2002&quot;<br>
            BY RAVI SHANKAR</b></p>

            </b>The high-tech trappings of electronic literature--laptops, e-book 
            readers, CD-ROMS--belie the fact that the field is framed in traditional 
            forms of discourse, such as critical prose that can be read in a book 
            or expounded upon from a lectern. It's a necessary irony, then, that 
            the practitioners, theorists and publishers in the emergent field 
            of e-literature periodically need to meet face-to-face in order to 
            better ascertain where they are and where they are headed. </p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.eliterature.org/index2.html" target="_blank">Electronic 
            Literature Organization</a> (or ELO)--a nonprofit organization founded 
            in 2000 by Scott Rettberg and Robert Coover to promote literature 
            designed for electronic media--held just such an event, its State 
            of the Arts Symposium, at UCLA. For three days, an international group 
            of over one hundred and fifty e-literates met to discuss the issues 
            surrounding the production and reception of electronic literature, 
            or e-literature for short. </p>
          <p>For many years, e-literature had chiefly been represented by hypertext, 
            more refined spawn of digital culture and choose-your-own-adventure 
            novels. The structure that differentiates hypertext from text is the 
            link, point of passage that allows the reader alternate paths through 
            a text. As e-literature theorist Jay Bolter writes, &quot;hypertext 
            presents itself to a reader as a series of possible texts, only one 
            of which is realized with each act of reading.<a href="#1">&sup1;</a>&quot; 
            Being an open-ended, de-centered, non-sequential system of signification, 
            hypertext empowers the reader to produce meaning, while suppressing 
            the notion that there is one finished Meaning that the author intends. 
            It's no surprise, then, that critics would gravitate towards the medium, 
            hypertext embodying the principles of indeterminacy and interactivity 
            posited by such thinkers as Jacques Derrida, who often uses link (<i>liasons</i>), 
            web (<i>toile</i>), and network (<i>r&eacute;seau</i>) in his writing, 
            and Roland Barthes, who famously asserts, &quot;the goal of literary 
            work is to make the reader no longer a consumer, but a producer of 
            the text<a href="#2">&sup2;</a>.&quot; </p>
          <p>In the last decade, however, e-literature has come to mean much more 
            than just hypertext. With the vast potentiality of creation on the 
            web, texts (hyper- or otherwise) have come to include still images, 
            audio, video and animation. Certain works, such as the science fiction 
            hypertext <i>Dark Lethe</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.darklethe.net" target="_blank">http://www.darklethe.net</a>&gt; 
            are predicated on the idea of collaboration and readers are encouraged 
            to add to the text as they explore it. Other works, such as the poems 
            curated on the site Poems that Go &lt;<a href="http://www.poemsthatgo.com" target="_blank">http://www.poemsthatgo.com</a>&gt;, 
            are kinetic texts in which words appear, disappear, move and morph 
            onscreen. </p>
          <p>Some e-literature maintains the form of its print counterpart but 
            adds an audio or visual element, such as the poems in The Cortland 
            Review &lt;<a href="http://www.cortlandreview.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cortlandreview.com</a>&gt;which 
            include audio recordings of poets reading their work. Still others, 
            like the poem by Jonathan Minton archived in the current issue of 
            Drunken Boat &lt;<a href="http://www.drunkenboat.com/db4/minton/minton.html" target="_blank">http://www.drunkenboat.com/db4/minton/minton.html</a>&gt;, 
            use an algorithmic process to randomly generate text, so that each 
            reading for each reader is a different experience. </p>
          <p>The proliferation of possible modes of expression has grown at such 
            an incredible rate that it's hard to keep track of what exactly e-literature 
            refers to, though that's not for lack of effort. Nick Montfort, one 
            of the participants in the ELO symposium, wrote a controversial essay 
            a few years ago and titled it after the Buggles' song, &quot;Cybertext 
            Killed the Hypertext Star.&quot; That piece and the subsequent impassioned 
            ripostes published in the Electronic Book Review &lt;<a href="http://www.altx.com/ebr/ebr11/11mon/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.altx.com/ebr/ebr11/11mon/index.html</a>&gt;show 
            how much is at stake in these new permutations of literature. If infighting 
            and heated academic debate are an indication of the vitality of an 
            artistic movement, e-literature has undoubtedly arrived. <a href="report2.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

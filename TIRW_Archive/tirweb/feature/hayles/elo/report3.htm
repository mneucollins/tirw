      <p>In the afternoon, the second keynote speaker, Robert Coover, the influential 
        writer, took the stage to discuss various electronic works he found intriguing. 
        He also commented on the moment surrounding his influential essay &quot;The 
        End of Books,&quot; published in The New York Review of Books in 1992. 
        At that point, one of few such moments in history, Coover was able to 
        discuss a genre in its entirety and, he claimed, review every existing 
        work in e-literature. He finished up his presentation by screening a short 
        film of the work he is doing with his students now. Much of this creation 
        comes from the time spent in the virtual reality environment at Brown 
        University, known as the CAVE &#153;. This immersive environment, which 
        heretofore had been the exclusive provenance of scientists, includes a 
        high-resolution virtual display theater and stereo-video and audio projection 
        equipment. Users, wearing stereographic glasses, can move and interact 
        with objects in the virtual environment the way they might if they were 
        dreaming. While they move, a supercomputer updates their surroundings 
        and their perspectives. As is often the case when one kind of technology 
        is discussed via the means of another, less powerful kind, the short film 
        could not do justice to the wildly surrealistic environment that Coover 
        conjured.</p>

      <p>After a brief recess for dinner, the crowd adjourned to the airy galleries 
        of the Hammer Museum where more electronic works were shown. These included 
        John Cayley's &quot;riverIsland,&quot; a dynamic, multi-voice exploration 
        of the iconographic nature of language in which transliteral morphing 
        took a Chinese poem through various algorithmic forms, Stephanie Strickland's 
        &quot;<a href="http://califia.hispeed.com/Errand/" target="_blank">The 
        Errand on Which we Came</a>,&quot; a graceful, imagistic hyper-poem that 
        begins &quot;Gentle reader, begin anywhere. Skip anything. This is framed 
        fully for the purposes of skipping. Of course, it can be read straight 
        through, but this is not a better reading, not a better life&quot; and 
        Caitlin Fisher's &quot;<a href="http://www.yorku.ca/caitlin/waves/" target="_blank">These 
        Waves of Girls</a>,&quot; winner of the ELO's 2001 Electronic Literature 
        Award. Fisher's performance was perhaps the most powerful of the symposium, 
        chiefly because she has such dramatic timing and because her prose so 
        accurately captures the fraught, fearful, feared world of nascent sexuality. 
        After the presentations, the e-literates lingered over chardonnay and 
        sushi, rhapsodizing the diverse works that had just graced the screen. 
      </p>
      <p>The final day was led off by a keynote speech by Jason Epstein, longtime 
        editorial director at Random House and founder of T<i>he New York Review 
        of Books</i>. Epstein was something of an odd choice to speak at the ELO 
        symposium, coming squarely as he did from the world of print media--and 
        sure enough, his comments were centered on the evolution of print publishing. 
        Epstein asserted that the inventions of digital technology was akin to 
        that of moveable type, and that just as the latter humbled popes and tyrants, 
        the former would eventually transform the outdated mechanisms of print 
        publishing. The elements that will propel this revolution, including the 
        ability to store and to transmit text electronically, are already in place, 
        though Epstein cautioned that publishers would fight what might prove 
        to be their own obsolescence with tooth and nail. </p>
      <p>Epstein descried current practices in publishing as outdated and wasteful, 
        vividly evoking the pity and terror the sight of a warehouse full of unsold 
        books awaiting destruction can cause. In the future, according to Epstein, 
        no book will exist until someone orders it. There will be no overprinting. 
        No wholesale markup. No unnecessary shipping costs. And as a result, the 
        consumer will pay less for a book while both author and publisher will 
        make more. The model Epstein described was a variation on existent Print-On-Demand 
        (POD) technologies, where with the touch of a key, anyone can order a 
        title from a vast virtual library. As for e-books, Epstein seemed certain 
        that they would not catch on, except in the case of encyclopedias, almanacs, 
        atlases, guide books or other sources of reference material where information 
        is apt to change with some regularity. He felt that, like the OED online, 
        such references would be available via subscription services, whereas 
        most pleasure reading would take place with the old-fashioned book. </p>
      <p>The symposium finished off with panels on multimedia criticism, publishing 
        and archiving work online, and the development of new web tools, such 
        as Eastgate Systems' content management assistant, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/" target="_blank">Tinderbox</a>, 
        Night Kitchen's interactive authoring tool, <a href="http://www.nightkitchen.com/product/index.phtml" target="_blank">TK3</a>, 
        and Bill Seaman's exploration of machine genetics, the Hybrid Invention 
        Generator. </p>
      <p>The tension between media as a computational tool and as a delivery destination 
        was brought up by the panel on multimedia criticism and Jane Yellowlees 
        Douglas, a specialist in hypertext/media and interactive fiction, discussed 
        the integration of navigational systems as a signifying component of the 
        text and not just as a means to access content. In addition, editors from 
        various online literary ventures, including &lt;<a href="http://www.drunkenboat.com" target="_blank">http://www.drunkenboat.com</a>&gt;, 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.studiocleo.com/cauldron/" target="_blank">http://www.studiocleo.com/cauldron</a>&gt;, 
        and &lt;<a href="http://www.poemsthatgo.com" target="_blank">http://www.poemsthatgo.com</a>&gt;, 
        discussed their aesthetic sensibilities and editorial process. William 
        Warner, Director of The Digital Cultures Project, raised some interesting 
        issues about how editors online act more as a frame than as a traditional 
        publisher, especially when works of art already exist somewhere on the 
        web. Finally, there was the requisite conversation about funding, or rather 
        about the lack thereof, and ultimately none of the ideas that were discussed 
        provided a viable means through which those interested in cultivating 
        the digital arts could manage to sustain themselves. </p>
      <p>After the final day of panels and a bon voyage banquet, the symposium 
        ended where it had began, with more presentations of electronic work, 
        plus an open-mike celebration of e-literature. </p>
      <p>I would warrant the palpable mood of those who had participated in the 
        three days of panels resolutely mixed. Where there was pride at being 
        a visionary and one of the first minds to grapple with and to harness 
        the force with which digital technology is inevitably transforming our 
        lives, there was also annoyance at having come too early, of having arrived 
        upon the multifarious and fertile lands of e-literature long before the 
        instruments of canonicity. Where there was delight in creating and discovering 
        new modes of expression, there was disappointment that the very newness 
        of the forms meant that funding, an audience, and academic validation 
        were still far off. Where there was gratification at having stepped away 
        from the screen's bare glare to commingle and to communicate with other 
        like-minded individuals, there were telltale hints of anxiousness, cliquishness, 
        and territoriality raising their spiky heads. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, in celebrating new works of e-literature and blueprinting 
        a handful of possible paths to the future, the symposium was a success. 
        The only irrefutable certainty to be gleaned from this meeting of the 
        minds is that digital technologies are here to stay. In the coming days, 
        many spheres, including but certainly not limited to, literature, will 
        be touched, if not permeated, by the effects of new tools, some of which 
        have already been invented and await deployment. Perhaps, as has been 
        hypothesized, ever-greater facility with and assimilation into these tools 
        will arrive in conjunction with a radical reconfiguration of what it means 
        to be human. Perhaps not. Just as in hypertext, this hypothesis could 
        prove both to be and not to be true. Every idea, every prediction, every 
        question, unlike in the linear trajectory of two millennia of printed 
        discourse, is subject to revision, to forming, to dispersing, to reforming 
        in an altered state, to being, as Jay Bolter writes, &quot;called back 
        into time and modified if not contradicted<a href="#3">&sup3;</a>.&quot;

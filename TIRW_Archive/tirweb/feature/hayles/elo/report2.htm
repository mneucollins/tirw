<p>Buoyed by such volatile issues and the enthusiasm of its participants, 
            the ELO conference began on April 4th with a cabaret of electronic 
            literature, which was held along with the rest of the conference in 
            the Kinross Building on UCLA's campus. Works such as Robert Kendall's 
            three-dimensional search for an interpretive path, &quot;<a href="http://www.wordcircuits.com/clues/" target="_blank">Clues</a>,&quot; 
            and Talan Memmott's interactive, cybertextual exploration of simulation 
            and the human face, &quot;<a href="http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/frame6/" target="_blank">Translucidity,</a>&quot; 
            were projected on a screen and navigated through by its respective 
            creator. </p>
          <p>Shelly Jackson read a passage anthropomorphizing the body's connective 
            tissues from her sinuous print novel, &quot;<a href="http://www.ineradicablestain.com/writing.html" target="_blank">The 
            Melancholy of Anatomy</a>,&quot; raising a question of how dependant 
            hypertext is on its medium. Critics such as George P. Landow have 
            maintained that certain print works like James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> 
            or Italo Calvino's <i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</i>, are actually 
            hypertexts because of their extreme openness and allusiveness. If 
            that's the case, Jackson's exquisite evocation of the body's internal 
            organs should take its place alongside those works. During the cabaret, 
            an interesting issue was raised by the performance of electronic works 
            as performance--even when new technologies were under examination, 
            the form reverted back to the &quot;writer reads&quot; paradigm, and 
            in nearly every case, hearing someone read their work was less engrossing 
            than actually getting to navigate it on a computer. </p>
          <p>The next day began with a speech by one of the symposium's keynote 
            speakers. N. Katherine Hayles, a professor of English at UCLA and 
            one of the leading thinkers on the synthesis of human and machine 
            (what she terms the post-human condition), addressed the audience 
            by taking account of where we stood as electronic folk. Hayles, having 
            been at the forefront of e-literature for some time, lamented the 
            passing of agrarian and communal principles from online communities. 
            Co-opted for economic ends, especially in the U.S., the kind of utopian 
            fervor that possessed the first e-writers has largely subsided and 
            been replaced by the kind of entrenchment that characterizes print 
            communities. </p>
          <p>Hayles also discussed the development and evolution of cognitive 
            environments in which humans and computers interact, often unobtrusively, 
            and she attempted to stake out the place of e-literature in that terrain. 
            One of her key concepts, which became something of a catch phrase 
            for the symposium, was obsolescence. Hayles articulated the fear of 
            many cyber- artists that in time their work will slough away due to 
            rapidly changing technological environments. The situation could be 
            seen as parallel to a musician whose music --everything from the guitar 
            she plays to the material she records on--is squarely based on eight-track 
            technology. What will happen to her work when tapes and CDs catch 
            on? For electronic writers, it's not a simple question of translation; 
            a hypertext written on a certain program and in a certain language 
            cannot just be squished to fit into updated technology. When its medium 
            changes, its content changes. Does the threat of impending obsolescence 
            render electronic work, especially in this incipient moment, futile? 
          </p>
          <p>Hayles raised this question but did not provide an answer, though 
            others, such as Mark Bernstein, chief engineer for the hypertext publisher 
            Eastgate, seemed to feel that the notion was exaggerated. Good work, 
            according to Bernstein, the kind that leads readers and scholars to 
            care passionately about it, will always survive. </p>
          <p>The panels that followed explored a variety of topics, from the existence 
            of graduate programs in electronic media to a discussion of the issues 
            current e-writers were facing. Rob Wittig, Director and Lead Writer 
            for Tank20 Literary Studio, discussed how the standards by which we 
            judge literature should not be loosened when we consider electronic 
            work. Wittig demands the same emotional and intellectual effect from 
            a hypertext, for example, as he does from a novel, and he wondered 
            how more people might be made to feel &quot;welcome&quot; into the 
            often-foreboding world of e-literature. </p>

          <p>Stuart Moulthrop, well known for his wide-ranging experiments in 
            digital narrative, was an especially refreshing panelist. He provided 
            the audience with various &quot;thought-experiments,&quot; for example, 
            asking how attached we are to the term &quot;literature,&quot; and 
            why we would feel embarrassed if it was replaced by the term &quot;game.&quot; 
            Another panelist, Diane Slattery, Associate Director of the Academy 
            of Electronic Media, discussed her <a href="http://www.academy.rpi.edu/%7Eslattd/glide_project.htm" target="_blank">Glide 
            project</a>, in which she constructs a purely visual language. According 
            to Slattery, our perceptual apparatus has changed immeasurably in 
            the last few centuries. Seeing vehicles such as the locomotive for 
            the first time, viewing entertainment such as the cinema, and ingesting 
            hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, humans have gradually begun to experience 
            language as secondary to image. Slattery's solution to the displacement 
            of word by image is to create a symbolic system where words are images. 
            She has created a language of glyphs that are given the qualities 
            of color, motion, and transformation. <a href="report3.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

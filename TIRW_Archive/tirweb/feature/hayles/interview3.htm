          <p><b>LG:</b> Yes, what about the future. I'm sure you've noticed the 
            press that Francis Fukuyama's new book is getting, which uses &quot;posthuman&quot; 
            in its title. Can you reflect on the &quot;legs&quot; your work has 
            and is having? What do you make of where it turns up and how?<br>
            <br>
            <b> NKH:</b> The first time I heard the word &quot;posthuman,&quot; 
            I thought, &quot;This is a viral term for sure!&quot; I knew it would 
            replicate quickly, and I wanted to have some input on how it was interpreted 
            and constructed. As you know, in <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> I 
            argue that there has been a tradition of erasing embodiment in cybernetics, 
            artificial intelligence, and artificial life. <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> 
            shows where some of these erasures occurred, demonstrates their consequences, 
            and argues that embodiment should be written back into picture. </p>
          <p>I wrote the book in part to try to come to terms with my own ambivalences 
            about posthuman developments. In a broad sense, these can be divided 
            between the biological (genetic engineering, etc.) and cybernetic 
            (artificial life, robotics, etc), although from the beginning there 
            have been strong connections between these two strands, and hybrid 
            entities are becoming increasingly important, such as silicon chips 
            combined with biological substrates. Posthuman is located within a 
            much broader landscape that includes scientists, engineers, artificial 
            life researchers and cognitive scientists as well as cultural and 
            literary critics. There are many stakeholders, of which I count myself 
            one, but since I deal mostly with the cybernetic strand, my work is 
            relatively more distant from the biological strand, about which many 
            others have written more directly. I am in the process of reading 
            Fukuyama's book now, so I cannot speak about it with authority. Nevertheless, 
            it is clear that he is more concerned with the biological strand than 
            I was in Posthuman. <br>
            I think it's fair to say his view is probably more dystopian than 
            mine, but I share many of his concerns and also worry about the cultural 
            implications of recent developments in cloning and other areas of 
            biomedicine. Eugene Thacker has recently written about some of the 
            biomedical developments as biomedia, a wonderful term that stresses 
            the confluence of information theory with molecular biology. Studies 
            like his, located at the crossroads of information theory, cybernetics, 
            biology, and media, indicate how the entangled these fields have become 
            and consequently how far-reaching their confluence is for many sectors 
            of society.<br>
            <br>
            As for the influence that Posthuman has had, it seems to be part of 
            discussions in Europe and especially in Scandinavia as well as in 
            the U.S. I wrote the book to bring certain issues into current conversations 
            about the posthuman, and to this extent, I think it has succeeded. 
            I am less concerned with whether others agree or disagree with me 
            than I am with wanting the issues to be examined, discussed, and debated. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>LG:</b> Where do you see your work going from here?</p>
          <p><b>NKH:</b> The implications of cybernetics continue to concern me, 
            especially the interactions of humans with intelligent machines. Another 
            current project is a book called <i>Coding the Signifier: Rethinking 
            Semiosis from the Telegraph to the Computer</i>, under contract to 
            the University of Chicago Press. It argues that coding technologies 
            like the telegraph and the computer have distinctive characteristics 
            that are unlike print and that should be theorized in their own right. 
            <i>Coding the Signifier</i> I see as a theoretical companion to <i>Writing 
            Machines</i>, extending the argument that literary criticism and theory 
            are shot through with assumptions specific to print, though largely 
            unrecognized as such. I evaluate current theories of semiotics and 
            argue that they do not take materiality sufficiently in account. <br>
            <br>
            What would it mean to have a theoretical discourse that can talk about 
            materiality and meaning together? That connects the embodiment of 
            texts to the embodiment of readers/users who respond kinesthetically 
            and proprioceptively as well as intellectually? Literature, I argue, 
            was never only words, never only disembodied verbal constructs. Texts 
            have bodies, readers and users have bodies, and meaning emerges from 
            material engagements with the rich resources of a physically vibrant 
            world as it is crafted through artistic practices and instantiated 
            in artifactual objects and processes. To settle for anything else 
            than a fully embodied and material practice of literary theory and 
            criticism is to risk impoverishing our understanding of the meaning-making 
            practices through which we engage the world. </p>
          <p>There was never been a better time than now, when the long hegemony 
            of print is giving way to the dynamic interactions of contemporary 
            media ecology, to rethink the assumptions of both print and electronic 
            literature. <br>
            <br>
            This does not mean, in my view, that print books are about to become 
            obsolete. Print technology is far too robust, durable and flexible 
            for that. Far from going the way of the dinosaur, books are going 
            the way of the human, changing as we change, mutating as we continue 
            to modify our ideas about who we are and what makes us tick. However 
            posthuman we style ourselves, we are going to writing and reading 
            books for a long time to come. <img src="../../images/x.gif" width="8" height="8"></p>

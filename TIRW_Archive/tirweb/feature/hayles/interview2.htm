          <p align="left"><b>Interview with N. Katherine Hayles, continued</b></p>
          <p align="left"><b>LG:</b> Is this instantiation of a work in a medium 
            what you've called &quot;materiality,&quot; or is &quot;the material&quot; 
            another category you think about in newly specific ways? I guess I'm 
            worried that many critics are using the word to mean many different 
            (and different amounts of) things. Is the materiality of a text the 
            literal fact of its existence in one medium or another, or is it some 
            range of forensic properties that help to produce its meaning?</p>
          <p><b>NKH:</b> Materiality, as I use the term, does not simply mean 
            all the physical, tangible aspects of the construction, delivery and 
            reading apparatus. Rather materiality is a selective focus on certain 
            physical aspects of an instantiated text that are foregrounded by 
            a work's construction, operation, and content. These properties cannot 
            be determined in advance of the work by the critic or even the writer. 
            Rather, they emerge from the interplay between the apparatus, the 
            work, the writer and the reader/user.<br>
            <br>
            Determining what counts as the materiality of a given work is thus 
            both a creative act by the writer and an interpretive act by the user, 
            as well as an engagement of the cognitive properties of an intelligent 
            machine for texts written and implemented on a computer. I don't see 
            this as a cause for anxiety. Materiality has always been in play, 
            even when it was relatively suppressed within literary criticism by 
            considering the work an immaterial verbal construction. In works that 
            foreground their interaction with materiality --&quot;technotexts&quot; 
            is the term I have coined for such works--the material properties 
            are actively constructed by the text and made resonant with significance, 
            becoming semiotically important components of the text's meaning-making 
            processes.</p>
          <p><b>LG: </b>I think I had misunderstood your use of the term and see 
            how rich the notion of materiality as a textual practice can be, in 
            effect, as something that happens rather than something that exists, 
            almost like opening the notion of reader response criticism wide enough 
            to let the varied and variable conditions of the medium in. This seems 
            directly related to the work of what you call the &quot;flickering 
            signifier.&quot; Is that right?</p>
          <p><b>NKH: </b>When I coined the phrase &quot;flickering signifier,&quot; 
            I had in mind a reconfigured relation between the signifier and signified 
            than that which had been previously articulated in critical and literary 
            theory. As I have argued elsewhere, the signifier as conceptualized 
            by Saussure and others was conceived as unitary in its composition 
            and flat its structure. It had no internal structure, whether seen 
            as oral articulation or written mark, that could properly enter into 
            the discourse of semiotics. </p>
          <p>When signifiers appear on the computer screen, however, they are 
            only the top layer of a complex system of interrelated processes. 
            Marks on screen may manifest themselves as simple inscriptions to 
            a user, but properly understood they are the visible, tangible results 
            of coding instructions executed by the machine in a series of interrelated 
            processes, from a high-level programming language like Java all the 
            way down to assembly language and binary code. </p>
          <p>I hoped to convey this processural quality by the gerund &quot;flickering,&quot; 
            to distinguish the screenic image from the flat durable mark of print 
            or the blast of air associated with oral speech. The signifier on 
            screen is, as you know, a light image produced by a scanning electron 
            beam. The screen image is deeply layered rather than flat, constantly 
            replenished rather than durable, and highly mutable depending on processes 
            mobilized by the layered code, as for example when a writer uses Flash 
            to create animation or layers that move. These qualities are not merely 
            ornamental but enter profoundly into what the marks signifier and, 
            more importantly, how they signify. We need a theory of semiotics 
            that can account for all the qualities connoted by &quot;flickering.&quot;</p>
          <p><b>LG:</b> In my work I've been trying to work through what that 
            semiotics might mean for history,--not the gee-whiz we're making history 
            sort of history, but rather the history that historians do, the disciplinary 
            practice of history. Do you have any suggestions on that score? Clearly 
            there are mutual changes emerging between the literary and its subjects, 
            and your work is crucial to explaining how that's happening. But what 
            about mutual changes that may be emerging between history and its 
            subjects? What if, for instance, the Macy Conferences you discuss 
            in Posthuman had all been on-line proceedings instead of stenographically 
            recorded and then printed in proceedings? In short, mustn't cybernetics 
            have emerged the way it did because of ITS (decidedly non-cybernetic) 
            materiality somehow?</p>
          <p><b>NKH:</b> It remains an ironic fact that our most durable record 
            of information processes and digital writing are print inscriptions. 
            The deeper we advance into digital technologies, the more apparent 
            it becomes that print is a far superior medium for archival purposes. 
          </p>
          <p>I think we are still sorting out our relation to the important and 
            intractable problems of digital archiving. I am especially concerned 
            with building and conserving an archive of electronic literature, 
            in a technological environment where any electronic work is likely 
            to be unplayable in 3-5 years, certainly by a decade. How will we 
            achieve the depth, breadth, and quality of the print archive--a treasure 
            store without which the practice of literature would be unthinkable--for 
            electronic works? This crucial issue is currently being addressed 
            by a number of organizations, including museums, text-encoding initiatives, 
            and in the case of literature, the Electronic Literature Organization. 
            Historians accept the idea that without an archive, the discipline 
            would be impossible. The same goes for literature. <a href="interview3.htm">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

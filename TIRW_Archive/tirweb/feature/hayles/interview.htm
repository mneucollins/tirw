            Lisa Gitelman:</b> Your book (<i>How We Became Posthuman</i>, Chicago 
            1999) is one that I find myself returning to again and again. I keep 
            discovering new things in it, and it keeps informing the work I do 
            on technologies of representation. Are you still working on the same 
            or on related issues? Could you describe your current project?<br>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><b>N. Katherine Hayles:</b> Right now I am finishing 
            up a book called <i>Writing Machines</i> to be published in September 
            2002 with MIT Press in their new Mediawork series edited by Peter 
            Lunenfeld. It carries on some of the arguments of Posthuman but in 
            a different vein. I have become very interested in the possibility 
            of media-specific criticism--a mode of critical inquiry attentive 
            to the materiality of the medium in which a literary work is produced.</p>
          <p align="left"><i>Writing Machines</i> argues that literary criticism 
            has for much too long tended to regard the literary work as an immaterial 
            verbal construct. My claim is that with significant exceptions, print 
            has become transparent for us because it is ubiquitous, the sea in 
            which we swim. Your own work on inscription technologies is one of 
            those exceptions, of course, along with the criticism of theorists 
            such as Johanna Drucker, Jerome McGann, and Matthew Kirschenbaum. 
            The connecting point with Posthuman is an emphasis on embodiment, 
            now understood as the interplay of a work's physicality with its signifying 
            practices.</p>
          <p align="left">Now that electronic textuality is bursting on the scene, 
            it seems we have a magnificent opportunity to think again about the 
            specificities of both print and electronic media, which can illuminate 
            one another by contrast. I hope to electrify the neocortex of literary 
            studies into recognizing that the print book is after all an interface 
            with its own presuppositions, assumptions, and configurations of the 
            reader. <br>
            <br>
            In <i>Writing Machines</i> I discuss three texts as case studies in 
            the specificity of media: Talan Memmott's electronic work <i>Lexia 
            to Perplexia</i>, Tom Phillips' artist's book <i>A Humument</i>, and 
            Mark Danielewski's print novel <i>House of Leaves</i>. Each reading 
            attempts to show how the text engages the materiality of its medium, 
            and how this materiality becomes so entwined with the content that 
            the two cannot be adequately understood apart from one another. <br>
            <br>
            I also wanted to devise a form that would invite in people who have 
            not yet thought much about electronic textuality, which I think includes 
            the majority of literary critics. So the theoretical/critical chapters 
            alternate with narrative chapters centered on an autobiographical 
            persona, Kaye, as she makes the journey from a print-oriented perspective 
            to a media perspective. This scheme is consistent with the aim of 
            the series, which is to produce small-format, richly designed books 
            that will appeal to a general reader as well as an academic audience. 
          </p>
          <p>The series matches each author with a print designer to ensure high 
            visual quality for each book. My collaborator is Anne Burdick, a wonderful 
            designer who has won major awards for her print designs and who also 
            designed the new interface for the &quot;<a href="http://www.altx.com/ebr/" target="_blank">Electronic 
            Book Review</a>.&quot; Her design will be very much an integral part 
            of the text, instantiating in visual form the major themes and ideas. 
            In exploring what a print book can be in a digital age, the Mediawork 
            series seeks to integrate the visual and the verbal, an enterprise 
            that also is central to the arguments of Writing Machines.</p>
          <p><b>LG:</b> Sounds very exciting. Does <i>Writing Machines</i> preserve 
            the category of &quot;the literary&quot;? It seems to me that the 
            literary often goes unquestioned and unexamined in ways that the liberal 
            humanist subject does not, although the two are obviously overlapping 
            or mutually acting constructions.</p>
          <p><b>NKH:</b> Yes, I do put considerable emphasis on the literary. 
            With the proviso, however, that what constitutes this elusive category 
            is continuously changing and mutating.<br>
            <br>
            Part of what I want to demonstrate is that interfaces in both print 
            and electronic works are reconfiguring the readerly subject by establishing 
            new relations between voice, (sub)vocalization, articulation, and 
            mark. At least since Marshall McLuhan, we have been inundated with 
            claims that information technologies are transforming subjectivity; 
            I count myself guilty on this score. </p>
          <p>But now I think we require microanalyses that show precisely and 
            rigorously how this transformation is being carried out by particular 
            texts, both print and electronic. Not that general claims will be 
            abandoned, of course, but we need a much more detailed understanding 
            of what is involved in the transformations and how they depend on 
            effects specific to the medium in which the work is instantiated.

          <b>Thom Swiss</b>: Thanks for premiering this new piece on IR Web. There's 
          a lot of interest in your work these days from many quarters--art world, 
          literary world, programming world...what do you call what you do?</p>
        <p><b>YOUNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES:</b> We combine text with jazz 
          to create Flash pieces. It's a simple technique that shuns interactivity, 
          graphics, photos, illustrations, banners, colors, and all but the Monaco 
          font, and at the same time cuts across the lines separating digital 
          animation, motion graphics, experimental video, <br>
          i-movies, and e-poetry. To us, though, it's Web art.</p>
        <p><b>TS</b>: Can you talk a bit about historical influences?</p>
        <p><b>YHCHI:</b> Well, we are writing in three different languages, English, 
          Korean, and French. (We collaborate with others when it comes to other 
          languages.) Each one comes with a full baggage of history and culture. 
          Language is the essence of the Internet, the real gateway to using the 
          Web.</p>
        <p>To write, read, and chat in English on the Internet is to implicitly 
          justify a certain history. Certain governments don't ban or burn books 
          anymore, they prevent access to the Web, meaning they justify a different 
          history than the one we do by using English. So our choice of language 
          is probably the biggest historical influence on our work.</p>
        <p><b>TS: </b>How about specific literary influences--or art and artists--how 
          do they figure into your work?</p>
        <p><b>YHCHI:</b> Well, <a href="http://www.yhchang.com/DAKOTA.html" target="_blank">DAKOTA</a>, 
          for example, is based on a close reading of Ezra Pound's Cantos I and 
          first part of II. Of course, you don't need to know this to enjoy the 
          piece. </p>
        <p>Other cultural influences on our work are Marcel Duchamp, who one day 
          decided to stop painting, saying he was tired of getting his hands dirty; 
          Roy Lichtenstein, who found a simple artistic vocabulary, and stuck 
          to it; and Andy Warhol, who, more than the Chinese government ever could, 
          succeeded with his Mao portraits in putting a certain face on China.</p>
        <p><b>TS:</b> Can you help readers &quot;locate&quot; your work in terms 
          of its tone? How about the &quot;look&quot; of your work?</p>
        <p><b>YHCHI:</b> It's pretty obvious that the &quot;tone&quot; or &quot;voice&quot; 
          of Internet literature is more distant and difficult to &quot;locate&quot; 
          than traditional writing. Mere book packaging tells a lot about the 
          book and the author; browser packaging is generic. Internet writers 
          can either see this as a problem or welcome it as a relief from the 
          critical<br>
          fashion of reading biography into every aspect of literature. </p>
        <p>As for the look of our work, we do what we can. We've never been interested 
          in graphic design (a lot of Web artists--and even writers-- start out 
          or double as graphic artists). There are hundreds of fonts, millions 
          of colors, and we don't know what to do about that.</p>
        <p>So to answer your question, no, we can't and won't help readers to 
          &quot;locate&quot; us. Distance, homelessness, anonymity, and insignificance 
          are all part of the Internet literary voice, and we welcome them.</p>
        <p><b>TS:</b> Can you say a few things about your process of collaboration?</p>
        <p><b>YHCHI:</b> We sit in front of our computers side by side on the 
          floor of our tiny pre-World War II Japanese house in Seoul and try to 
          ignore each other. Something inevitably comes up, and the laughs--sorry 
          -- the collaboration process begins.</p>
        <p><b>TS:</b> What do you make of the critical writing out there thus 
          far on Web-based art and Web-based writing?</p>
        <p><b>YHCHI:</b> There isn't much critical writing yet on Web writing. 
          One reason is that it's a young medium. Another is that it's not taken 
          very seriously (i.e., there's no money in it). Still another is that<br>
          it's more satisfying to create than to criticize. </p>
        <p>There's a tendency to read quickly on the Internet. Speed is everything, 
          and densely written texts, be they creative or critical, seem to make 
          the reader anxious -- maybe because of the phone bill. Then again, maybe 
          another reason for the dearth of critical Web writing is that there's 
          nothing to criticize -- Web writing might not be very good.</p>
        <p><b>TS:</b> Let's hope that's not true! Thanks, Young-hae and Marc.</p>

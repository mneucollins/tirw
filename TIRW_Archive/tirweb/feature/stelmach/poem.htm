  <p><b>Argument Against Our Temporal Agoraphobia</b></p>
  <p>For Virgil, history's slope was not a given, as for us who drearily assume<br>
    a singular, closed past, matched to a future careeningly wide open. We dream</p>
  <p>infinities of choice, beginning now and spreading out into our own remaining 
    spans<br>
    as easily as we might (and have, for better or for worse), set off for lands</p>
  <p>uncharted (proposing only out of here), worlds woven of the possible and 
    im-<br>
    (cloven humans, heads beneath their shoulders; unicorns; lizards born of mud). 
    For him,</p>
  <p>a man deferring philosophy for the long years after art, and dying at the 
    seam<br>
    where the two might profitably have met, both Past and Future posed their 
    open</p>
  <p>questions. The argument came to this: either memory and history (i.e., the 
    chartered<br>
    past) can equally ignore the banks, slip the borders, and spread, flood-smeared</p>
  <p>over a vast, featureless landscape, all its familiar landmarks hidden<br>
    by the waves of our multi-directional wakes, or the future, too, is fixed 
    and bidden</p>
  <p>by gods. Which? Logic's a thing you can't have both ways: symmetry requires<br>
    the single fulcrum and the stance-which, we're told, is all a man can claim 
    as his</p>
  <p>and all he needs. Two worlds to move in the here-and-now: time to abandon<br>
    as Dante did, even a half-life's certainty. Ascending our treacherous mountain</p>
  <p>peering only up, how can we claim a knowledge-declare a single, reliable 
    fact-<br>
    concerning our craven, encumbered selves or the cloven historians at our backs.</p>

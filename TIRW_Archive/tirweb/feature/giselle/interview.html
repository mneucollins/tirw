            </b><b> AN INTERVIEW WITH GISELLE BEIGUELMAN<br>
            </b> </p>
          <p><b>Ingrid Ankerson:</b> We're delighted to feature your work in this 
            first issue of the new IR Web. Do you see your work as an extension 
            of concrete or visual poetry? </p>
          <p><b>Giselle Beiguelman:</b> Yes and No. I really like concrete and 
            visual poetry and I think I was influenced by &quot;concrete poetry 
            ways&quot; of composition. </p>
          <p>But I think those genres generally aim to make textual meaning emerge 
            from the visual surface--and Poetrica generally aims at just the opposite. 
            That is, it means to create visual meaning from non-textual characters, 
            exploring new boundaries of non-phonetic language.</p>
          <p>Computer-based work introduces algorithmic aesthetics into our cultural 
            and artistic practices, and I'm very attracted to that.</p>
          <p><b>IA: </b>Can you name some concrete or visual poets, contemporary 
            or<br>
            historical, that our readers should be or should become familiar with? 
          </p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> I grew up in S&atilde;o Paulo, an important center of 
            visual and<br>
            concrete poetry, where Augusto and Haroldo de Campos and D&eacute;cio 
            Pignatari worked (and still work, although Pignatari is now living 
            elsewhere). They were very important for my generation. </p>
          <p>Other favorites include Braga, who explored different ways of writing<br>
            (sometimes drawing, sometimes using different materials and surfaces--like 
            stones and wood; Paulo Leminsky (who wrote amazing haiku); and Andr&eacute; 
            Vallias. </p>
          <p><b>IA:</b> Giselle, talk a little about the process of writing the 
            algebraic<br>
            equations that make up your &quot;no-poems&quot;.</p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> I think I am developing in &quot;Poetrica&quot; some issues 
            that I explored in my first cyber-work (<a href="http://www.desvirtual.com/giselle/" target="_blank">The 
            Book after the Book</a>). The epigraph of that work was: &quot;at 
            the intersections of words and symbols we begin to redefine our boundaries...&quot; 
          </p>
          <p>&quot;Poetrica&quot; has this statement in its core! Also, in &quot;The 
            Book,&quot; I wrote a lot about the novelty of hybrid/digital culture, 
            the mix of phonetic and non-phonetic substrata.</p>
          <p>The process of creation on this new project, nevertheless, has been 
            romantic, mysterious. I'm researching many kinds of fonts and &quot;dings&quot; 
            and some of them &quot;force&quot; me to do something. I experiment 
            a lot, superpose them, cut, divide, multiply layers... sometimes I 
            try to do make changes with vectors and suddenly I'm headed on a whole 
            new track. So there is a lot of &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; in it.</p>
          <p><b>IA:</b> You say this project is also conceived for PDAs. Do you 
            consider<br>
            this an early attempt at a new genre of New Media art?</p>
          <p><b>GB: </b>I think PDAs and Mobile phones are the icons of our time. 
            They made us proto-cyborgs, supporting our nomadic way of life. We 
            need those devices because we are always on the move, but to create 
            art for those interfaces is a challenge. The question now is: how 
            to conceive of an art form made to be experiences&quot;in between&quot; 
            --that is, while doing other things?</p>
          <p>&quot;Poetrica&quot; also explores the phenomena of the &quot;second-hand 
            original,&quot; which is constitutive of digital culture.</p>
          <p>All of my &quot;no-poems&quot; are conceived for different interfaces 
            (Web, PDAs, plotters, old printers, etc). They are identical, but 
            their &quot;reading interfaces&quot; are different.</p>
          <p><b>IA:</b> One last question then. Are you influenced in any way 
            by music?</p>
          <p><b>GB:</b> Yes, always music: Piazzola, Vinicius de Moraes, Baden 
            Powell, Cassia Eller, Eurythmics, Paralamas do Sucesso, Lob&atilde;o, 
            Arnaldo Antunes, The Smiths, Frente, New Order, and Gilberto Gil. 
            I've been listening lately to The Best of 386DX by Alex Shulgin.</p>
